# Introduction

Humans generate [[./index#Introduction|phones]] by using various parts of the respiratory and digestive systems to manipulate airflow. 

## The Vocal Tract

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: The Vocal Tract
>
>The **vocal tract** is the system of organs used to produce speech.
>

Familiarizing yourself with the anatomy of the vocal tract is crucial to understanding how sounds are made. 

![[res/The Vocal Tract - Basic Annotations.svg]]

At a fundamental level, the vocal tract comprises the lungs, trachea, larynx, pharynx, epiglottis, oral cavity (including the tongue inside it) and the nasal cavity.

### Trachea

The **trachea** (**windpipe**) is the pipe that goes down the throat and into the lungs. It is responsible for carrying air into and out of the lungs. 

### Larynx

The **larynx** (**voice box**) is where the **vocal folds** (**vocal cords**) reside. The space between the vocal folds is known as the **glottis**. The larynx's primary use is in [[Speech Production#Phonation|phonation]]. 

### Epiglottis

Above the larynx lies the **epiglottis**, which is a flap of elastic cartilage whose main purpose is to close the entrance to the trachea when swallowing to prevent food from entering the lungs. However, it can also be used to produce certain sounds. 

### Oral Cavity

The **oral cavity** is the empty space between the lips and the back of the throat. It is where the **teeth** and the **tongue** reside. The tongue is one of the most important organs for speech as it is used in the production of the vast majority of [[./index#Introduction|phones]]. 

### Nasal Cavity

Above the oral cavity lies the **nasal cavity**, i.e. the empty space behind the nostrils, extending to the back of the throat. 

### Pharynx

The **pharynx** is the empty space behind the nasal and oral cavities, the epiglottis, and above the larynx. It is generally divided into three parts: the **nasopharynx** (the empty space behind the nasal cavity), the **oropharynx** (the empty space behind the oral cavity), and the **laryngopharynx** (the space behind the epiglottis).

# Airstream Mechanisms

As previously stated, [[./index#Introduction|phones]] are produced by manipulating airflow within the [[Speech Production#The Vocal Tract|vocal tract]]. However, different ways of generating this airflow result in different sounds.

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Initiator
>
>The **initiator** is the organ in the [[Speech Production#The Vocal Tract|vocal tract]] that creates the movement of air necessary for the production of a given [[./index#Introduction|phone]].
>

The three main initiators are the lungs, the [[Speech Production#Larynx|vocal folds]] and the tongue and three mechanisms are distinguished based on these initiators.

## Pulmonic Mechanism

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Pulmonic Mechanism
>
>The **pulmonic mechanism** uses the lungs as the [[Speech Production#Airstream Mechanisms|initiator]] of airflow.
>

The **diaphragm** is the primary muscle involved in generating airflow by the pulmonic mechanism. It resides below the lungs. When the diaphragm contracts, it flattens and moves downwards, increasing the volume of the lungs and drawing air into them. When the diaphragm relaxes, it moves upwards, compressing the lungs and pushing air out of them.

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Egressive Pulmonic Mechanism
>
>The **egressive pulmonic mechanism** is the [[Speech Production#Pulmonic Mechanism|pulmonic mechanism]] in which the diaphragm relaxes and pushes air out of the lungs.
>

The vast majority of [[./index#Introduction|phones]] in human languages are pulmonic egressives. In fact, most languages (including all European languages) use only pulmonic egressive sounds.

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Ingressive Pulmonic Mechanism
>
>The **ingressive pulmonic mechanism** is the [[Speech Production#Pulmonic Mechanism|pulmonic mechanism]] in which the diaphragm contracts in order to allow air to flow into the lungs.
>

The use of pulmonic ingressive [[./index#Introduction|phones]] is extremely limited. In fact, pulmonic ingressive sounds used in actual words have only been found in Damin, a ritual language formerly spoken by speakers of Lardil in Australia. However, pulmonic ingressives are quite common in interjections to indicate various social cues, such as that someone is about to begin speaking.

## Glottalic Mechanism

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Glottalic Mechanism
>
>The **glottalic mechanism** uses the [[Speech Production#Larynx|glottis]] as the [[Speech Production#Airstream Mechanisms|initiator]] of airflow.
>

This mechanism utilizes two closures of the [[Speech Production#The Vocal Tract|vocal tract]]. First, the [[Speech Production#Larynx|vocal folds]] come together and close the [[Speech Production#Larynx|glottis]] entirely. This prevents airflow from going into and out of the lungs. Then, a second closure is produced somewhere else in the [[Speech Production#The Vocal Tract|vocal tract]], usually using the tongue. The airflow is then generated by either raising or lowering the [[Speech Production#Larynx|larynx]] and releasing the second closure, while keeping the [[Speech Production#Larynx|glottis]] sealed.

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Egressive Glottalic Mechanism
>
>The **egressive glottalic mechanism** is the [[Speech Production#Glottalic Mechanism|glottalic mechanism]] in which the [[Speech Production#Larynx|larynx]] is raised.
>

When the [[Speech Production#Larynx|larynx]] is raised, it compresses the air between the two closures. The built-up pressure subsequently causes the air to flow outwards when the second closure is released.

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Ingressive Glottalic Mechanism
>
>The **ingressive glottalic mechanism** is the [[Speech Production#Glottalic Mechanism|glottalic mechanism]] in which the [[Speech Production#Larynx|larynx]] is lowered.
>

When the [[Speech Production#Larynx|larynx]] is lowered, the increase in the space between the two closures causes a drop in the pressure of the air between them. When the second closure is released, this difference in pressure causes air to be sucked in.

## Velaric Mechanism

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Velaric Mechanism
>
>The **velaric mechanism** uses the tongue as the [[Speech Production#Airstream Mechanisms|initiator]] of airflow.
>

First, the back of the tongue moves upwards and backwards to close the throat. Then, the front of the tongue is raised to create another closure somewhere in the [[Speech Production#Oral Cavity|oral cavity]]. Finally, the part of the tongue between the two closures is lowered, causing the air pressure between them to drop. When the tip of the tongue releases the closure, air is sucked in.

# Phonation

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Phonation
>
>**Phonation** refers to the way the vocal folds in the [[Speech Production#Larynx|larynx]] are vibrating when a given [[./index#Introduction|phone]] is produced.
>

Here, the primary distinction is between **voiceless** and **voiced** sounds.

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Voiceless Sound
>
>A [[./index#Introduction|phone]] is **voiceless** if the [[Speech Production#Larynx|vocal folds]] do not vibrate when the sound is produced.
>

English has many voiceless sounds such as the "s" in "sing" or the "th" in "thin".

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Voiced Sound
>
>A [[./index#Introduction|phone]] is **voiced** if the [[Speech Production#Larynx|vocal folds]] vibrate when the sound is produced.
>

Examples of voiced sounds in English include the "z" in "zone" and the "b" in "boot".

>[!TIP] Tip: Testing for Phonation
>
>You can easily determine whether a [[./index#Introduction|phone]] is voiced or voiceless by placing your hand on your throat, below your chin (near your Adam's apple, if you have one) and then making the sound. If you feel vibration when the sound is produced, then it is voiced. Otherwise, it is voiceless.
>

## Voices

There are multiple ways in which a [[./index#Introduction|phone]] can be [[Speech Production#Phonation|voiced]] depending on the precise way in which the [[Speech Production#Larynx|vocal folds]] vibrate during its production. 

|Voice|Description|Example|
|:--:|:--|:--:|
|Modal Voice|This is the normal voice you usually use when speaking.|![[res/Modal Voice.wav]]|
|Breathy Voice|This voice is produced when the [[Speech Production#Larynx\|vocal folds]] vibrate without appreciable contact between each other.|![[res/Breathy Voice.wav]]|
|Creaky Voice (Vocal Fry)|This voice is produced when the [[Speech Production#Larynx\|vocal folds]] vibrate in an irregular manner with low frequency.|![[res/Creaky Voice.wav]]|

>[!NOTATION]- Notation: IPA for Voices
>
>The [[./index#The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)|IPA]] notation for the various voices is as follows:
>- By default, every [[Speech Production#Phonation|voiced]] [[./index#Introduction|phone]] is assumed to be pronounced with [[Speech Production#Voices|modal voice]] and this does not require any explicit notation.
>- [[Speech Production#Voices|Breathy voice]] is indicated either with the diacritic `◌̤` or the superscript ◌ʱ - [d̤], [a̤], [dʱ], [aʱ].
>- [[Speech Production#Voices|Creaky voice]] is indicated by the `◌̰` diacritic - [a̰], [d̰].
>

In most languages, the type of voice is not contrastive - it does not affect the meaning of the words spoken. However, there are languages such as the Jalapa dialect of Mazatec where pronouncing the same [[./index#Introduction|phone]] with different voices can result in drastically different meanings. Nevertheless, these are very rare.

# Articulation

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Articulation
>
>**Articulation** refers to the mechanism by which airflow is modified in order to produce a given [[./index#Introduction|phone]].
>

There are three main aspects of [[Speech Production#Articulation|articulation]] - the articulators, the place or point of articulation and the manner of articulation.

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Articulator
>
>The **articulators** are the organs used to modify airflow.
>

The most common articulator is the tongue.

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Place of Articulation
>
>The **place of articulation** (**point of articulation**) is the location where the modification of airflow happens.
>

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Manner of Articulation
>
>The **manner of articulation** is the precise way in which airflow is modified.
