# Welcome to Eisodos!
 
Welcome to **Eisodos**, the entrance to the [[index#the city of knowledge|city of knowledge]]. Here you will find *diadromes* (Greek for "path", "route"). Each diadromi is essentially a map which you can follow in order to study a particular subject. Inside each diadromi you will find the pages which to read as well as the order in which to read them so as to learn the subject of interest. Since subjects can be vast, diadromi will most likely include prerequisites, i.e. topics which you should already know before following the diadromi. Such prerequisites will be clearly stated in the diadromi and may take the form of links to other diadromes or just links to the necessary concepts if they are not too many.
