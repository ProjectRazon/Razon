# What is Razon?

Razon is a knowledge repository whose goal is to serve as a free educational resource for anyone who wants to self-study science or merely supplement their university / high school courses. Head to [[Usage]] in order to learn how to get the most out of the project. 

## The City of Knowledge

Perhaps the best way to illustrate Razon is to use the following analogy. Imagine Razon as a huge city, a city of knowledge. Every page is like a *building* occupied by pieces of knowledge. Folders are the *districts* where buildings are located and links serve as *streets* connecting various buildings. Tags are like *signs* on each building, indicating what purpose the building serves - is it a groceries store, a pharmacy, an office building?

Using the same analogy, Razon's users, i.e. you, can be likened to *tourists* visiting the city of knowledge. You can also become a permanent resident of Razon by [[Contributing]] to the project.

Every city needs tourist information centres to inform its tourist about the sites they can visit and how to get to them, lest they feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of activities to do and places to visit. However, Razon's size necessitates an entire district of such centres and this district is [[index|Eisodos]].
