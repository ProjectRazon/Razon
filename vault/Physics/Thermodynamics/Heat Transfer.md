>[!LAW] Empirical Law: Heat Transfer
>
>Two [[Physical System|physical systems]] which are *not* at [[Thermal Equilibrium]] will interact with each other and exchange [[Kinetic Energy]] until such an equilibrium is reached.

>This process is called **heat transfer** - we say that [[Heat]] *flows* from the system with higher [[Temperature]] into the system with lower [[Temperature]].
>- When [[Heat]] flows *out* of a [[Physical System]], the system loses [[Kinetic Energy]] and so [[Heat]] is considered negative - from the point of view of the system with higher [[Temperature]], [[Heat]] is negative, since the total [[Kinetic Energy]] of the system *decreases* during heat transfer.
>- When [[Heat]] flows *into* a [[Physical System]], the system gains [[Kinetic Energy]] and so [[Heat]] is considered positive - from the point of view of the system with lower [[Temperature]], [[Heat]] is positive, since the total [[Kinetic Energy]] of the system *increases* during heat transfer.
