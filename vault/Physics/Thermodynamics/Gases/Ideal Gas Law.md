>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Ideal Gas Law
>
>The [[Pressure]] $p$ which an [[Kinetic-Molecular Model of an Ideal Gas|ideal gas]] exerts on the walls of the container it occupies is related to the volume $V$, the temperature $T$ of the gas and the number of gas particles $N$ by the equation:

>pV = k_BNT,

>where $k_B$ is the [[Boltzmann Constant]].

>>[!NOTE]

>>Alternatively, the law can be expressed via the [[Molar Gas Constant]] $R$ and the amount of substance $n$:
