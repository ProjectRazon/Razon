>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Internal Energy of an Ideal Gas
>
>The [[Internal Energy]] $U$ of an [[Kinetic-Molecular Model of an Ideal Gas|ideal gas]] depends on the number $f$ of [[Degrees of Freedom of Gas Particles|degrees of freedom of a single gas particle]], the total number $N$ of particles and the [[Temperature]] $T$ of the gas and is given by the following equation, where $k_B$ is the [[Boltzmann Constant]]:
>
>$$
>U = \frac{f}{2}k_BNT

>>[!NOTE]
>>
>>Alternatively, $U$ can be expressed in terms of the amount of substance $n$ and the [[Molar Gas Constant]] $R$.
