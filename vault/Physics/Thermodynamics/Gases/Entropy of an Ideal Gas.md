>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Entropy of an Ideal Gas
>
>The **entropy** of an [[Kinetic-Molecular Model of an Ideal Gas|ideal gas]] is defined as the product of the [[Boltzmann Constant]] $k_B$ and the natural logarithm of the [[Multiplicity]] $\Omega$ of its [[Kinetic-Molecular Model of an Ideal Gas|macrostate]].

>The infinitesimal change $\mathrm{d}S$ in the [[Entropy of an Ideal Gas|entropy]] of an [[Kinetic-Molecular Model of an Ideal Gas|ideal gas]] depends on its [[Temperature]] $T$ and the infinitesimal amount $\mathrm{d}Q$ of [[Heat]] which flows into it.
