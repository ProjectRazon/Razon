>An **isohoric process** is a process in which the volume of the [[Kinetic-Molecular Model of an Ideal Gas|gas]] does not change.

>>The [[Internal Energy]] of the gas is
>>
>>$$
>>U = \frac{f}{2}n R T
>>$$
>>
>>Since the gas does no work in an isohoric process, the [[The First Law of Thermodynamics|first law of thermodynamics]] tells us that the change in the internal energy depends only on the [[Heat]] which enters / exits the gas.

>>\mathrm{d}U = \mathrm{d}Q
>>$$
>>
>>From this follows
>>
>>$$
>>\mathrm{d}Q = \frac{f}{2}n R \mathop{\mathrm{d}T} \implies \frac{\mathrm{d}Q}{\mathrm{d}T} = \frac{f}{2}n R
>>$$
>>
>>The left-hand side is just the gas's [[Heat Capacity]] $C$.
>>
>>$$
>>C = \frac{\mathrm{d}Q}{\mathrm{d}T} = \frac{f}{2}n R
>>$$
>>
>> To obtain the *molar* heat capacity, we need to divide $C$ by the number of moles $n$.

>>C_V = \frac{C}{n} = \frac{f}{2}R
