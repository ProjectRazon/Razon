>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Isobaric Process

>An **isobaric process** is a process in which the [[Pressure in a fluid|pressure]] of the [[Kinetic-Molecular Model of an Ideal Gas|gas]] remains constant.

>The [[Work]] $W$ which an [[Kinetic-Molecular Model of an Ideal Gas|ideal gas]] does during an [[Ideal Gases in Isobaric Processes|isobaric process]] depends on its [[Pressure in a fluid|pressure]] $p$ and the change $\Delta V$ in its volume:

>>Let $V_i$ and $V_f$ denote the initial and the final volume of the gas,Since $p$ is constant and does not depend on the volume, [[Work of an Ideal Gas|this theorem]] gives us
