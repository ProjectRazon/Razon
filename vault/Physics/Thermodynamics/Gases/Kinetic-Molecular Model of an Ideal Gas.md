>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Kinetic-Molecular Model of an Ideal Gas
>
>The **kinetic-molecular model of an ideal gas** is an idealisation of gases which makes the following assumptions:
>
>>[!AXIOM] Axiom: Assumptions of the Kinetic-Molecular Model
>>
>>1. The gas is comprised of a very large number of identical particles, each with mass $m$, which are enclosed in a container with volume $V$.
>>2. These particles are very small compared to the size of the container and to the average distance between particles and therefore behave as [[Point Mass|point masses]].
>>3. These particles are moving constantly and occasionally [[Elastic Collision|colliding elastically]] with the walls of the container.
>>4. The container walls are rigid, infinitely massive and thus unable to move.

>An [[Kinetic-Molecular Model of an Ideal Gas|ideal gas]] in thermodynamics is [[Parameter|parameterized]] in two different ways:
>- Microscopically, through the [[Position|positions]] and [[Momentum|momenta]] of all of its particles - the [[Physical State]] of the gas with respect to this microscopic [[Parameter|parameterization]] is its [[Microstate and Macrostate|microstate]].
>- Macroscopically, through its [[Pressure in a fluid|pressure]] $p$, [[Temperature]] $T$, volume $V$ and number of particles $N$ - the [[Physical State]] of the gas with respect to this macroscopic [[Parameter|parameterisation]] is its [[Microstate and Macrostate|macrostate]].
