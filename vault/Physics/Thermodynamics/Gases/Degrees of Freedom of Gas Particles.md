>[!IMPORTANT] Important: Degrees of Freedom of a Single Gas Particle
>
>In the [[Kinetic-Molecular Model of an Ideal Gas]], we consider only those [[Degree of Freedom|degrees of freedom]] of its particles which result in some form of [[Mechanical Energy]].
>
>- Monoatomic gas molecules have $3$ degrees of freedom, since each particle is just a point whose [[Velocity]] has three independent components. We consider only the translational [[Kinetic Energy]], since single points cannot rotate and the [[Kinetic-Molecular Model of an Ideal Gas|kinetic-molecular model]] of an [[Kinetic-Molecular Model of an Ideal Gas|ideal gas]] is simple and does not include [[Potential Energy|potential energies]].
>- Diatomic gas molecules have $5$ degrees of freedom, since each particle is represented by a molecule consisting of two atoms represented as points. There are $3$ [[Degree of Freedom|degrees of freedom]] again due to the molecule's [[Velocity]] which has three independent components, but there are an additional $2$ [[Degree of Freedom|degrees of freedom]] which come from the fact that the molecule has two possible axes of rotation. The axes are only two and not three, since rotation abound the line joining the two atoms is not possible - a point cannot rotate around itself.
