>[!LAW] Empirical Law: Temperature Change
>
>The change $\Delta T$ in the [[Temperature]] $T$ of a [[Physical System]] depends on the [[Heat]] $Q$ which flows into or out of it:
>- If [[Heat]] flows *into* the [[Physical System|system]] $(Q \gt 0)$, then its [[Temperature]] *increases* $(\Delta T \gt 0)$.
>- If [[Heat]] flows *out* of the [[Physical System|system]] $(Q \lt 0)$, then its [[Temperature]] *decreases* $(\Delta T \lt 0)$.
>
>When the [[Temperature]] change is relatively small, the [[Heat]] required to achieve it is approximately proportional to it:
>- The [[Heat]] $Q$ can be expressed via the mass $m$ and the [[Specific Heat Capacity]] $c$ of the substance.
>
>$$
>Q = c m\Delta T

>
>- The [[Heat]] $Q$ can be expressed via the moles $n$ and the [[Molar Heat Capacity]] $c_m$ of the substance.

>Q = c_m n \Delta T
