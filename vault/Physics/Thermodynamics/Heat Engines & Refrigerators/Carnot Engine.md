>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Carnot Engine
>
>The **Carnot engine** is a [[Heat Engine]] based on an [[Kinetic-Molecular Model of an Ideal Gas|ideal gas]] which undergoes the following *Carnot cycle*:
>
>1. The gas expands [[Ideal Gases in Isothermal Processes|isothermally]] at [[Temperature]] $T_\text{H}$, absorbing [[Heat]] $Q_\text{H}$.
>2. The gas expands [[Ideal Gases in Adiabatic Processes|adiabatically]] until its temperature drops to $T_\text{C}$.
>3. The gas is compressed isothermally at temperature $T_\text{C}$, releasing heat $|Q_\text{C}|$.
>4. The gas is compressed adiabatically back to temperature $T_\text{H}$.

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Thermal Efficiency of the Carnot Engine
>
>No [[Heat Engine]] can have a higher [[Thermal Efficiency]] than that of a [[Carnot Engine]], which is given by the [[Temperature]] $T_\text{H}$ of the [[Heat Engine|hot reservoir]] and the temperature $T_\text{C}$ of the [[Heat Engine|cold reservoir]] as follows:
>
>$$
>\eta_\text{Carnot} = \frac{T_\text{H} - T_\text{C}}{T_\text{H}}
