>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Coefficient of Performance of the Carnot Refrigerator
>
>No [[Refrigerator]] can have a higher [[Coefficient of Performance]] than that of the [[Carnot Refrigerator]], which is given by the [[Temperature]] $T_\text{C}$ of the [[Refrigerator|cold reservoir]] and the temperature $T_\text{H}$ of the [[Refrigerator|hot reservoir]].
