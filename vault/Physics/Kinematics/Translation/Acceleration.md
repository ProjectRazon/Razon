>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Average Acceleration
>
>The **average acceleration** of a [[Point Mass]] during a time interval $\Delta t$ is the ratio of the change in its [[Velocity]] between the moments $t_1$ and $t_2 \gt t_1$ and the interval's duration:

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Instantaneous Acceleration
>
>The **instantaneous acceleration** of [[Point Mass]] at a moment $t_0$ is its average velocity within an infinitely small time interval after $t_0$:

>\boldsymbol{a}(t_0)\overset{\text{def}}{=} \lim_{\Delta t\to 0}\boldsymbol{a}_{\text{avg}} = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0}\frac{\boldsymbol{v}(t_0+\Delta t)-\boldsymbol{v}(t_0)}{\Delta t} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{v}}{\mathrm{d}t}(t_0)
