# Introduction

**Physics** is the branch of science which studies the most fundamental laws and principles governing the world around us. However, there are common misconceptions about what lies in the purview of physics and what does not.

Most importantly, physics does *not* seek to answer the question of what reality *is* - this question is left to the philosophers. The sole purpose of physics is to formulate a *description* of reality which is based on observations of it and which can be used to predict its future.

These descriptions are usually called **models** and the only criteria we have about them is that their predictions agree with observations. However, *how* they reach those predictions and if reality *actually* functions in the way the model says is usually impossible to verify and thus irrelevant to physics. A single phenomenon may be described equally well by multiple different models and, as long as the predictions made by these models agree with observations, we consider them to be equally correct. In fact, the only reason we might prefer one model than another from two equivalent models is that it is simpler and thus easier to explain.
