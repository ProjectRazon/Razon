# Space and Time

What space and time *are* is a philosophical question and not a physical one. As physicists, what we need is a way to [[index|model]] them which yields useful predictions. 

The most common model, although not the only one, fuses the concepts of space and time into a single entity called **spacetime**. Mathematically, this entity is a 4-dimensional [[Manifolds|manifold]] with some special properties. An $n$-dimensional manifold is a [[Sets#Sets|set]] with certain properties. Once again, the question of *what* the elements of this set *are* is left to the philosophers - you can think of them as infinitesimally small drops of some aetheric substance if you like. What matters to us is describing *how* these elements behave. To this end, we have given them the rather unfortunate name of **events**.
