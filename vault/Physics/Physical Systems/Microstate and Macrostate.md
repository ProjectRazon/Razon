>Suppose we have two [[Parameter|parameterisations]] $P_1$ and $P_2$ of a [[Physical System]] with $n_1$ and $n_2$ [[Parameter|parameters]], respectively.
>
>If $n_1 \lt n_2$ and the values of all [[Parameter|parameters]] in $P_2$ can be determined if we know the values of all [[Parameter|parameters]] in $P_1$, then any [[Physical State]] from $P_1$ is called a **microstate** and any [[Physical State]] from $P_2$ is called a **macrostate**.
