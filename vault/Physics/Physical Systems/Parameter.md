>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Parameter
>
>A **parameter** of a [[Physical System]] is any characteristic of the [[Physical System|system]] which can be quantified mathematically.
>
>>[!NOTE]
>>
>>Parameters can be pretty arbitrary, but we are usually only interested in those which are useful for physical predictions and obey certain laws such as position, momentum, temperature, pressure, etc.
>>
>
>>[!EXAMPLE]- Example: Room Full of People
>>Imagine a [[Physical System]] which consists of a room full of people. The average age of the people is a parameter of the [[Physical System|system]], since it can be quantified mathematically by a number.
>>
>
>>[!EXAMPLE]- Example: Cyclops Staring at a Wall
>>
>>Consider a [[Physical System]] consisting of a cyclops staring at a wall with its single eye. The direction from which it is looking at the wall is a parameter of the [[Physical System|system]], since it can be quantified by a vector.

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Parameterisation
>
>A **parameterisation** of a [[Physical System]] is any set of [[Parameter|parameters]] of the [[Physical System|system]] which we choose to examine and consider relevant.
>
>>[!EXAMPLE]- Example: Gas
>>
>>A gas is often parameterised by its volume, pressure, temperature and number of molecules, but this is just one possibility. An alternative parameterisation could be its density, mass and total kinetic energy of its molecules.

>>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Equivalent Parameterisations
>>
>>Two [[Parameter|parameterisations]] of a [[Physical System]] are **equivalent** if it is possible to calculate the values of all [[Parameter|parameters]] in the first from the values of all [[Parameter|parameters]] in the second and vice versa.
