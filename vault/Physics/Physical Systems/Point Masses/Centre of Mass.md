>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Centre of Mass
>
>The **centre of mass** of a [[Physical System]] of [[Point Mass|point masses]] is an imaginary [[Point Mass]] whose mass $M$ is the sum of the masses $m_1,m_2,\cdots$ of its components and whose [[Position]] $\boldsymbol{r}_\text{cm}$ is the mass-weighted average of the [[Position|positions]] $\boldsymbol{r}_1,\boldsymbol{r}_2,\cdots$ of its components:
>
>$$M \overset{\text{def}}{=} \sum_{k}m_k \qquad \boldsymbol{r}_\text{cm} \overset{\text{def}}{=} \frac{1}{M} \sum_k m_k\boldsymbol{r}_k$$
