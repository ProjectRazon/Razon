>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Conservative Force
>
>A [[Force]] $\boldsymbol{F}$ is **conservative** if it satisfies the following criteria:
>
>1. The [[Work]] done by $\boldsymbol{F}$ depends only on the start and end positions of the [[Point Mass]] it acts on, i.e. it is [[Position|path]]-independent.
>
>2. The [[Work]] done by $\boldsymbol{F}$ along any closed [[Position|path]] $\mathcal{O}$ is $0$.
>
>$$
>\oint_{\mathcal{O}}\boldsymbol{F} \cdot \mathop{\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{r}} = 0
>$$
>
>3. The [[Force]] $\boldsymbol{F}$ is a gradient field.
>
>>[!NOTE]
>>
>>If $\boldsymbol{F}$ satisfies at least one of these criteria, then it satisfies all of them.
