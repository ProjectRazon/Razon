>>We consider an interaction between any two objects $A$ and $B$ in the physical system. According to [[Newton's Laws of Translational Motion#^thirdlaw|Newton's third law of motion]], this interaction manifests as two [[Force|forces]] $\boldsymbol{F}_{A \text{ on } B}$ and $\boldsymbol{F}_{B \text{ on } A}$ with

>>According to [[Newton's Laws of Translational Motion#^secondlaw|Newton's second law of motion]] the [[Force]] $\boldsymbol{F}_{A \text{ on } B}$ is equal to the change $\frac{\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{p}_B}{\mathrm{d}t}$ in the [[Momentum]] of $B$ and the [[Force]] $\boldsymbol{F}_{B \text{ on } A}$ is equal to the change $\frac{\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{p}_A}{\mathrm{d}t}$ in the [[Momentum]] of $A$. This means that

>>\frac{\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{p}_A}{\mathrm{d}t} = -\frac{\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{p}_B}{\mathrm{d}t}

>>
>>$$
>>\frac{\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{p}_A}{\mathrm{d}t} + \frac{\mathrm{d}\boldsymbol{p}_B}{\mathrm{d}t} = \boldsymbol{0}

>>
>>Therefore, the change in the total [[Momentum]] of $A$ and $B$ is zero and is thus unaffected by [[Internal Force|internal forces]]. This is true for any pair of objects in the [[Physical System]] and so it must be true for the total [[Momentum]] of the entire system. This means that the total [[Momentum]] is only affected by [[External Force|external forces]] and if there are no such forces, then it is not affected by anything and therefore remains unchanged.
