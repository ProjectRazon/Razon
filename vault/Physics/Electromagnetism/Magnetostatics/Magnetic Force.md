>[!LAW] Empirical Law: Magnetic Force
>
>Every [[Electric Charge|point charge]] $q$ moving through a [[Magnetic Field]] $\boldsymbol{B}$ with [[Velocity]] $\boldsymbol{v}$ experiences a **magnetic [[Force]]** $\boldsymbol{F}$:
>
>$$
>\boldsymbol{F} = q\, \boldsymbol{v} \times \boldsymbol{B}
>$$
>
>>[!NOTE] Note: Direction of the Magnetic Force
>>
>>The direction of $\boldsymbol{F}$ can be determined via the right hand rule. Point the index finger of your right hand in the direction of $\boldsymbol{v}$ and your middle finger in the direction of $\boldsymbol{B}$. If you now raise your thumb, it will point in the direction of $\boldsymbol{F}$.
