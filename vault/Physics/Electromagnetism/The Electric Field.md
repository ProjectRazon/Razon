# Introduction

In principle, [[Coulomb's Law]] can be used together with the [[Force|superposition principle]] to describe the [[Coulomb's Law|electrostatic forces]] between many [[Electric Charge|point charges]]. However, this process becomes very complicated and tedious as the number of charges increases and is outright impossible to use when dealing with [[Electric Charge|continuous charge distributions]].

# The Model of the Electric Field

It turns out that we can paraphrase [[Coulomb's Law]] in a way to make this simpler. We imagine that space is filled with a [[Real Vector Field|vector field]], i.e. that each point $\mathbf{r}$ is assigned a [[Real Vector|vector]] $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r})$. This vector depends on the spatial configuration of all [[Electric Charge|electric charges]] and can be used to calculate the total [[Coulomb's Law|electrostatic force]] which would act on a [[Electric Charge|point charge]] if it were placed at rest at $\mathbf{r}$.

>The **electric field** at the point $\mathbf{r}$ is defined to be the [[Real Vector|vector]] $\mathbf{E}$ such that if a [[Electric Charge#Modelling Electric Charge|point charge]] $q$ is positioned at $\mathbf{r}$ and is at rest, then the total [[Coulomb's Law|electrostatic force]] $\mathbf{F}$ which acts on $q$ is given by $q$ and the electric field $\mathbf{E}$ at $\mathbf{r}$ as follows:

>>If the charge $q$ is positive, then $\mathbf{F}$ points in the same direction as $\mathbf{E}$. Conversely, if $q$ is negative, then $\mathbf{F}$ points in the exact opposite direction.

[[Coulomb's Law]] and the concept of the electric field are equivalent - we can use the former to derive the latter and the latter to derive the former. They are two equivalent models of the same thing. However, the electric field is generally a lot easier to work with, especially when multiple charges are involved. More importantly, it can even be used to calculate the total electromagnetic force on a *moving* charge.

# Sources of Electric Fields

The [[The Electric Field|electric field]] can be generated by [[Electric Charge|electric charges]] or by a time-varying [[Magnetic Field]].

>where $\mathbf{r}_{\mathbf{r}_Q \to \mathbf{r}} = \mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_Q$ is the [[Real Vector|vector]] which points from $\mathbf{r}_Q$ to $\mathbf{r}$, $r = ||\mathbf{r}_{\mathbf{r}_Q \to \mathbf{r}}||$ is the [[Euclidean Distance|distance]] between $\mathbf{r}_Q$ and $\mathbf{r}$, and $\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{\mathbf{r}_Q \to \mathbf{r}}$ is the [[Unit Vector]] which points in the direction of $\mathbf{r}_{\mathbf{r}_Q \to \mathbf{r}}$.

>>If $Q$ is positive, then the $\mathbf{E}_Q(\mathbf{r})$ always points radially away from $Q$. Conversely, if $Q$ is negative, then $\mathbf{E}_Q(\mathbf{r})$ towards $Q$.

So defined, the electric field yields the same results as [[Coulomb's Law]].
