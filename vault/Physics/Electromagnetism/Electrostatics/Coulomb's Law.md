# Coulomb's Law

Coulomb's law governs how [[Electric Charge|electric charges]] interact with each other when they are both at rest.

>[!LAW] Empirical Law: Coulomb's Law

>Every pair of [[Electric Charge|point charges]] $q_1$ and $q_2$ which are both at rest interact with a pair of [[Force|forces]], $\mathbf{F}_{\text{on } q_1}$ and $\mathbf{F}_{\text{on } q_2}$, which we call **electrostatic forces**. We refer to which depend on the [[Electric Charge|charges]] $q_1$ and $q_2$,  the distance $r$ between them and the [[Permittivity]] $\varepsilon$ of their environment.

>- Magnitude - the electrostatic forces $\mathbf{F}_{\text{on } q_1}$ and $\mathbf{F}_{\text{on } q_2}$ have the same magnitude which depends on $q_1$ and $q_2$, the square of the distance $r$ between them and is proportional to a constant $\varepsilon$ which is a characteristic of the environment of the two charges called the [[Permittivity]]:

>- Direction - the electrostatic [[Force|forces]] always act along the line joining $q_1$ and $q_2$. It is repulsive if both [[Electric Charge|charges]] have the same algebraic sign, and it is attractive if they have different signs.

>Equations for the electrostatic forces as vectors can be written using the [[Unit Vector|normalized]] difference between their positions, where $\displaystyle \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{q_1 \to q_2} = \frac{1}{||\mathbf{r}_{q_2} - \mathbf{r}_{q_1}||}\mathbf{r}_{q_2} - \mathbf{r}_{q_1}$ and $\displaystyle \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{q_2 \to q_1} = \frac{1}{||\mathbf{r}_{q_1} - \mathbf{r}_{q_2}||}\mathbf{r}_{q_1} - \mathbf{r}_{q_2}$:
