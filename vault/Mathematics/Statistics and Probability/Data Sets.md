# Data Sets

We need a way to organize statistical data.

>A **data set** is a [[Multisets|multiset]].

Each element of a data set represents a value that was measured for a [[TODO|random variable]] and its multiplicity is the number of times this value was measured.

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: (Absolute) Frequency
>
>The **(absolute) frequency** of the $i$-th data point in a [[Data Sets|data set]] is its [[Multisets|multiplicity]].

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Relative Frequency
>
>The **relative frequency** of the $i$-th data point in a [[Data Sets|data set]] $S$ is the ratio of its [[Data Sets|absolute frequency]] to the [[Multisets|cardinality]] of the data set.
