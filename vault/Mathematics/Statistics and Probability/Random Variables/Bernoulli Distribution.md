# Bernoulli Distribution

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Bernoulli Distribution
>
>Suppose we have some [[Experiments|experiment]] and let $X$ be a [[Random Variables#Discrete Random Variables|discrete random variable]] with exactly two possible values $\{A, \bar{A}\}$.
>
>We say that $X$ has a **Bernoulli distribution** if there exist a [[The Real Numbers|real number]] $p \in (0;1)$ such that $P(X = A) = p$ and $P(X = \bar{A}) = 1 - p$.
>
>>[!NOTE]
>>
>>We often say that $p$ is the parameter of the Bernoulli distribution of $X$ or that $X$ is distributed according to the Bernoulli distribution with parameter $p$.
