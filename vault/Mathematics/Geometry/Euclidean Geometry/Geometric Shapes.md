# Geometric Shapes

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Geometric Figure
>
>A **geometric figure** in the [[The Topology of Euclidean Space|Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ is any [[Sets|subset]] $G \subset \mathbb{R}^n$.

# Similarity

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Similarity
>
>Two [[Geometric Shapes]] $G_1$ and $G_2$ are **similar** iff there exists a transformation $f$ which is a combination of a translation and a scaling such that

>$$
>f(G_1) = G_2 \qquad \text{ and } \qquad f^{-1}(G_2) = G_1

# Congruence

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Congruence
>
>Two [[Geometric Shapes]] $G_1$ and $G_2$ are **congruent** if there exists an [[Isometry]] which maps $G_1$ onto $G_2$.

>>[!INTUITION]-
>>
>>The two geometric figures are congruent if there is a way to move and rotate one of them in such a way so as to make it coincide with the other figure.
