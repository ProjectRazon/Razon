# Cartesian Coordinates

Cartesian coordinates are the simplest and most commonly used coordinates. They identify each [[Euclidean Geometry|point (vector)]] in the [[The Topology of Euclidean Space|Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ by its components. Essentially, the $k$-th Cartesian coordinate of $\mathbf{p}$ is its $k$-th component.

>>We denote coordinates using superscripts instead of subscripts, i.e. $x^1, \dotsc, x^n$ instead of $x_1, \dotsc, x_n$, in order to make it clear that we are talking about coordinates and not components. However, since the values of a point's Cartesian coordinates coincide with the values of its components, you might sometimes see the Cartesian coordinates labelled using subscripts.
