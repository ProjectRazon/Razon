# Cylindrical Coordinates

Cylindrical coordinates are a natural extension of the [[Polar Coordinate System]] to three dimensions. They identify each point in the [[The Topology of Euclidean Space|Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^3$ by its distance from the $z$-axis, the angle $\phi$ its projection in the $xy$-plane makes with the $x$-axis and its $z$ component.

## Conventions

Some people prefer to use $\theta$ or $\varphi$ for the azimuth.

Additionally, a single point has infinitely many possible values for its azimuth, since adding or subtracting a multiple of $2\pi$ to an angle has no effect. However, in order to have a [[index|coordinate system]], coordinates must be unique. This means that the possible values for $\phi$ must be restricted. Common conventions for the range of $\phi$ are $[0; 2\pi)$ and $(-\pi, \pi]$.
