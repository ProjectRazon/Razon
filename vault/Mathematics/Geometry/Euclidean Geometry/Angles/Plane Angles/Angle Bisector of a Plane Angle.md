>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Angle Bisector of a Plane Angle
>
>Let $\angle(a;b)$ be the [[Plane Angle]] formed by two [[Rays]] $a$ and $b$.
>
>There exists one and only one [[Straight Line]] $l$ in the [[Planes|plane]] of $\angle(a;b)$ which goes through the [[Plane Angle|vertex]] of $\angle(a;b)$ such that the angles $\angle(a; l)$ and $\angle (l; b)$ are [[Geometric Shapes|congruent]].

>>The **angle bisector** of a [[Plane Angle]] is the unique [[Straight Line]] which lies in the [[Planes|plane]] of the angle, goes through its vertex and divides it into two [[Geometric Shapes|congruent]] angles.
