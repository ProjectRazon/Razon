# Lines and Planes in 3D

>[!THEOREM]- Theorem: Line and Point $\implies$ Plane
>
>If $l$ is a [[Straight Lines in 3D|straight lines]] and $P$ is a [[Euclidean Geometry|point]] which does not lie on $l$, then there exists a unique [[Planes in 3D|plane]] $\lambda$ which contains both $l$ and $P$.

>[!THEOREM]- The Theorem of Three Perpendiculars
>
>Let $a$ be a [[Straight Lines in 3D|straight line]] which intersects the [[Planes|plane]] $\alpha$ and let $b$ be a [[Straight Lines in 3D|straight line]] which lies in $\alpha$.
>
>Then $a$ and $b$ are [[Straight Lines in 3D|perpendicular]] if and only if the [[TODO|projection]] of $a$ onto $\alpha$ is [[Straight Lines in 3D|perpendicular]] to $b$.
