# Straight Lines in 3D

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Straight Line
>
>A **straight line** in [[Stereometry|3D space]] is an [[TODO|unbounded]] [[Stereometry|locus of points]] which is [[Homeomorphic Spaces|homeomorphic]] to the [[The Real Numbers|real numbers]] $\mathbb{R}$.
>

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Angle between Straight Lines
>
>Let $a$ and $b$ be [[Straight Lines in 3D|straight lines]] in 3D.
>
>The **angle** between $a$ and $b$ is the [[Angle]] between any pair of [[Euclidean Geometry|vectors]] such that one of the [[Euclidean Geometry|vectors]] is between [[Euclidean Geometry|points]] which lie on $a$ and the other is between [[Euclidean Geometry|points]] which lie on $b$.

## Properties

>[!THEOREM]- Theorem: Intersecting Lines $\implies$ Plane

# Parallel Lines

>[!THEOREM]- Theorem: Parallel Lines and Points
>
>If $a$ is a [[Straight Lines in 3D|straight line]] in [[Stereometry|3D space]], then for each point $P$ there exists a unique [[Straight Lines in 3D|straight line]] $b$ which goes through $P$ and is [[TODO|parallel]] to $a$.

>[!THEOREM]- Theorem: Parallel Lines $\implies$ Plane

# Skew Lines

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Skew Lines
>
>**Skew lines** are two [[Straight Line|straight lines]] in [[Stereometry|3D space]] which do not lie in the same [[Planes|plane]].
>

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Angle between Skew Lines
>
>Let $a$ and $b$ be [[Straight Lines in 3D#Skew Lines|skew lines]], let $a_1$ and $a_2$ be [[Straight Lines in 3D#Parallel Lines|parallel]] to $a$ and let $b_1$ and $b_2$ be [[Straight Lines in 3D#Parallel Lines|parallel]] to $b$.
>
>If $a_1$ and $b_1$ intersect and $a_2$ and $b_2$ also intersect, then the [[Angle between Lines|angles]] they form are equal.

>>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Angle between Skew Lines
>>
>>The **angle** between two [[Straight Lines in 3D|skew lines]] $a$ and $b$ is the [[Angle between Lines|angle]] between any pair of intersecting [[Straight Lines in 3D|lines]] $a'$ and $b'$ such that $a$ and $a'$ are [[Straight Lines in 3D#Parallel Lines|parallel]] and $b$ and $b'$ are also [[Straight Lines in 3D#Parallel Lines|parallel]].
