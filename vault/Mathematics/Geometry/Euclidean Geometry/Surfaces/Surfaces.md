>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Surface
>
>A **surface** in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a [[Sets|subset]] $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ for which there exists a [[Continuity of Real Vector Functions|continuous]] [[Functions of the Real Numbers|function]] $\varphi: \mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^n$ on a [[The Topology of Euclidean Space#Connectedness|connected set]] $\mathcal{D}$ whose [[Functions|image]] is $\mathcal{S}$ and which is [[Injections, Surjections and Bijections|injective]] on $\mathcal{D}$ except possibly at the [[Interior, Boundary and Exterior|boundary]] $\partial \mathcal{D}$.
