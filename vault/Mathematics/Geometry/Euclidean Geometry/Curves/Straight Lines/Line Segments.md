# Line Segments

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Line Segment
>
>A **line segment** is a [[Curves|curve]] which has no [[Curvature]] and has a [[Parametric Curve|parametrization]] of the form $\gamma: [a;b] \to \mathbb{R}^n$.
>
>>[!NOTATION]-
>>
>>If $A = \gamma(a)$ and $B = \gamma(b)$, then we denote the line segment as
>>
>>$$
>>AB \qquad \overline{AB} \qquad BA \qquad \overline{BA}
>>$$

## Extension

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Extension of a Line Segment
>
>For each [[Line Segments|line segment]] $s$ there exists one and only one [[Straight Line]] $l$ which contains $l$, i.e. $s \subset l$.

>>[!PROOF]-

>
>>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Extension of a Line Segment
>>
>>The **extension** of a [[Line Segments|line segment]] is the unique [[Straight Line]] which contains it.

# Midpoint

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Midpoint
>
>The **midpoint** of a [[Line Segments|line segment]] is the [[Euclidean Geometry|point]] which divides it into two [[Geometric Shapes|congruence]] line segments.
