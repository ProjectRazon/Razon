>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Straight Line
>
>A **straight line** (or just **line**) is an [[Bounded Curve|unbounded]] [[Curves|curve]] whose [[Curvature]] is zero everywhere.

>>[!NOTATION]-
>>
>>Straight lines are usually denoted with lowercase Latin letters: $a,b,c, p,q, m,n,l,$ etc.
>>
>>If we know two points $A$ and $B$ which lie on the line, then we can also denote the line as either of the following:
>>
>>$$
>>AB \qquad \overline{AB} \qquad BA \qquad \overline{BA}
>>$$

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Straight Line through Two Points
>
>If $P_1$ and $P_2$ are two distinct [[Euclidean Geometry|points]] in $n$-dimensional [[The Topology of Euclidean Space|Euclidean space]], then there exists one and only one [[Straight Line]] $l$ which contains both points, i.e. $P_1 \in l$ and $P_2 \in l$.
