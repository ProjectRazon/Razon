# Circle

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Circle
>
>Let $\lambda$ be a [[Planes|plane]], let $O \in \lambda$ and let $r \gt 0$.
>
>The **circle** $k$ with radius $r$ and center $O$ is the [[Geometric Shapes|geometric figure]] comprised of all points in $\lambda$ which are a distance $r$ from $O$.

>>$$k(O;r)$$

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Radius
>
>A **radius** of the [[Circle]] $k(O;r)$ is any [[Line Segments|line segment]] whose endpoints are the center $O$ of the circle and a point lying on the $k$.

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Diameter

>A **diameter** of a [[Circle]] is a [[Circle|chord]] which passes through the circle's [[Circle|center]].

>>The length $d$ of every diameter of the [[Circle]] $k(O;r)$ is equal to twice the length of $k$'s radius.

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Circumference and Radius
>
>The ratio of a [[Circle]]'s [[Circle#Circumference|circumference]] $C$ to its [[Circle|radius]] $R$ is always $2\pi$.

# Surface Area
