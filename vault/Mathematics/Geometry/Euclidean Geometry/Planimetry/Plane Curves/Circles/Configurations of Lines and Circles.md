# Configurations of Lines and Circles

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Line and Circle Intersections

>There are three possible cases for a [[Straight Line]] and a [[Circle]]:
>- They have *no* points of intersections.
>- They intersect at *one* point.
>- They intersect at *two* points.

# External Lines

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: External Line
>
>Let $p$ be a [[Straight Line]] and let $k(O; r)$ be a [[Circle#Circle|circle]] such that all points of  [[Circle#Circle|circle]]
>
>If all points of $p$ lie outside of $k$, then $p$ is known as an **external line** for $k$.

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: External Lines in a Plane
>
>If a [[Straight Line]] $p$ and a [[Circle#Circle|circle]] $k(O; r)$ lie in the same [[Planes|plane]] and do not intersect, then $p$ is an [[Configurations of Lines and Circles|external line]] for $k$.

# Tangent Lines

## Characterizations

>[!THEOREM]- Theorem: Perpendicularity of Tangent Lines
>
>Let $k(O;r)$ be a [[Circle#Circle|circle]] and let $p$ be a [[Straight Line]] which intersects $k$ at a point $P$.
>
>The line $p$ is a [[Configurations of Lines and Circles#Tangent Lines|tangent line]] if and only if the [[Circle#Circle|radius]] from $O$ to $P$ is [[TODO|perpendicular]] to $p$.

## Properties

>[!THEOREM]-
>
>If $k(O; r)$ is a [[Circle#Circle|circle]] and $p$ is a [[Configurations of Lines and Circles#Tangent Lines|tangent line]], then all points of $p$, apart from the point of intersection with $k$, lie outside of $k$.

>[!THEOREM]- Theorem: Tangent Lines through External Points
>
>Let $k(O; r)$ be a [[Circle#Circle|circle]].
>
>If $P$ is a point outside of $k$ but which lies in the [[Planes|plane]] of $k$, then there exist precisely two [[Configurations of Lines and Circles#Tangent Lines|tangent lines]] to $k$ which pass through $P$. Moreover, the [[Triangles]] formed by $P$, $O$ and the points of intersection are [[Triangles|congruent]].

# Secant Lines

>A [[Straight Line]] is a **secant line** to a [[Circle#Circle|circle]] iff they intersect at two points.

## Properties

>
>Let $k(O; r)$ be a [[Circle#Circle|circle]].

>If $s_1$ and $s_2$ are two [[Configurations of Lines and Circles#Secant Lines|secant lines]] such that $s_1$ intersects $k$ at the points $A$ and $A'$, $s_2$ intersects $k$ at the points $B$ and $B'$, and the two secant lines intersect each other at $C$, then the [[Triangles]] $\triangle CAB'$ and $\triangle CBA'$ are [[TODO|similar]].

>>[!PROOF]-
>>
>>The [[Angles#Inscribed Angles|inscribed angles]] $\angle AB'B$ and $\angle BA'A$ are equal, since they have the same [[Angles#Inscribed Angles|corresponding arc]], namely $\overset{\frown}{AB}$. The angle $\angle A'CB'$ is shared by both triangles. The third angles of the triangles are then equal because the sum of the angles in a triangle is always $180\degree$. Since the triangles have equal
