# Chords

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Chord
>
>A **chord** in a [[Circle]] is any [[Line Segments|line segment]] whose endpoints are [[Euclidean Geometry|points]] of the circle.

## Properties

>[!THEOREM]- Intersecting Chords Theorem
>
>If $AC$ and $BD$ are [[Chords]] in a [[Circle]] $k(O; r)$ and they intersect at $S$, then $S$ divides each chord such that the product of the lengths of the two segments of one chord is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments of the other chord. Moreover, this product is given by the [[Circle#Circle|radius]] $r$ and the distance $l$ between $O$ as follows:
>
>$$
>|AS| \cdot |SC| = |BS| \cdot |BD| = r^2 - l^2
>$$

>The converse is also true - if two [[Line Segments]] $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at a point $S$ which divides each segment such that $|AS| \cdot |SC| = |BS| \cdot |BD|$, then $AC$ and $BD$ are [[Chords]] in a [[Circle#Circle|circle]].
