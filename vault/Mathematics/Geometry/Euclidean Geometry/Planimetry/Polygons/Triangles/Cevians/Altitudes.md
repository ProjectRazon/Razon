>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Altitude
>
>An **altitude** in a [[Triangles|triangle]] is a [[Line Segments|line segment]] $h$ with the following properties:
>- The endpoints of $h$ are a [[Polygons|vertex]] $V$ of the triangle and a [[Euclidean Geometry|point]] on the [[Line Segments|extension]] of the [[Polygons|side]] $s$ opposite to $V$.
>- The segment $h$ is [[Angle between Lines|perpendicular]] to the extension of $s$.
>
>>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Base
>>
>>The [[Polygons|side]] which an [[Altitudes|altitude]] is [[Angle between Lines|perpendicular]] to is known as the altitude's **base**.
>> 
>
>>[!NOTATION]-
>>
>>If the base of an altitude is $s$, we often denote the altitude itself with $h_s$.

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Orthocenter
>
>The [[Line Segments|extensions]] of the three [[Altitudes]] in a given [[Triangles|triangle]] are [[Concurrent Lines|concurrent]].

>>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Orthocenter
>>
>>The [[Euclidean Geometry|point]] of intersection of the [[Line Segments|extensions]] of a [[Triangles|triangle]]'s [[Altitudes]]  is known as the triangle's **orthocenter**.
