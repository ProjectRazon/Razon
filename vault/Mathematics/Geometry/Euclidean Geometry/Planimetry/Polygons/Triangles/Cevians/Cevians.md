# Cevians

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Cevian
>
>A **cevian** in a [[Triangles|triangle]] is a [[Line Segments|line segment]] whose endpoints are a [[Polygons|vertex]] of the triangle and a [[Euclidean Geometry|point]] on the [[Polygons|side]] opposite to the vertex.

>Let $T$ be a [[Triangles|triangle]] with [[Polygons|sides]] $a,b,c$.

>If a [[Cevians|cevian]] $d$ divides $a$ into two [[Line Segments|segments]] $m$ and $n$ such that $n$ shares a [[Polygons|vertex]] with $b$ and $m$ shares a vertex with $c$, then

>>[!THEOREM]- Theorem: Ceva's Generalized Theorem
>>
>>[[Cevians#Properties|Ceva's theorem]] can be generalized to the case where $A'$, $B'$, $C'$ are three points such that two of the points lie on the extensions of two sides of $\triangle ABC$ and the third lies on the third side. However, the aforementioned equality know guarantees either that the [[Straight Line|lines]] $AA'$, $BB'$ and $CC'$ are [[Concurrent Lines|concurrent]] or that they are [[TODO|parallel]].
