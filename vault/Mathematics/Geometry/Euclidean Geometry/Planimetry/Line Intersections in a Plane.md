>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Lines in a Plane
>
>For every two distinct [[Straight Line|straight lines]] which lie in the same [[Planes|plane]] there are two possibilities:
>
>- The lines intersect in a single [[Euclidean Geometry|point]].
>- The lines do not intersect.

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Parallel Lines
>
>Two [[Straight Line|straight lines]] are **parallel** if they lie in the same [[Planes|plane]] but do not [[Line Intersections in a Plane|intersect]].
