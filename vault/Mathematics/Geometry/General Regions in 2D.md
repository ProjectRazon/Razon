>A **general region** of in $\mathbb{R}^2$ is a [[Sets|subset]] $D\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ which can be described in one of the following ways for two real numbers $a,b$ and two [[Continuity|continuous]] [[Functions of the Real Numbers|real functions]] $l,u: [a;b] \to \mathbb{R}$:

>- Type I: $D = \{(x,y) \mid a\le x\le b, l(x) \le y \le u(x)\}$
>- Type II: $D = \{(x,y) \mid l(y) \le x \le u(y), a \le y \le b\}$
