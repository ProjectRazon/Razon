>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Smoothness of Functions on Manifolds
>
>Let $f: M \to \mathbb{R}^n$ be a [[Functions of the Real Numbers|real vector-valued function]] on a $k$-dimensional [[Smooth Manifolds|smooth manifold]].
>
>We say that $f$ is **smooth** iff for each $p \in M$ there exists a [[Smooth Manifolds|smooth chart]] $(U, \phi)$ such that $p \in U$ and the [[Composition]] $f \circ \phi^{-1}: \phi(U) \subseteq \mathbb{R}^k \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is [[Partial Derivatives of Real Vector Functions|smooth]].
