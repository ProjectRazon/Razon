# Smooth Atlases

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Smooth Atlas
>
>An [[Atlases|atlas]] is **smooth** iff all of its [[index|charts]] are $C^{\infty}$-[[index|compatible]].
>

# Smooth Structures

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Smooth Structure
>
>A **smooth structure** on a [[Manifolds|manifold]] is a [[Atlases|maximal]] [[Smooth Manifolds|smooth atlas]].
>
>>[!NOTE]
>>
>>Smooth structures are also known as **differentiable structures**.

# Smooth Manifolds

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Smooth Manifold
>
>A **smooth manifold** $(M, \mathcal{S})$ is a [[Manifolds|manifold]] $M$ equipped with a [[Smooth Manifolds|smooth structure]] $\mathcal{S}$.
>
>>[!NOTE]
>>
>>Although a smooth manifold technically has two components - a manifold $M$ and a smooth structure $\mathcal{S}$, - if $\mathcal{S}$ is understood from context we usually this technicality and just call $M$ a smooth manifold.

## Smooth Charts

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Smooth Chart
>
>Let $(M, \mathcal{S})$ be a [[Smooth Manifolds|smooth manifold]].
>
>A **smooth chart** is any [[index|chart]] $(U, \phi)$ contained in the [[Smooth Manifolds|smooth structure]] $\mathcal{S}$.
>
>>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Smooth Coordinate System
>>
>>The [[index|coordinate system]] of a [[Smooth Chart]] is known as a **smooth coordinate system**.
