>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Convergence of Sequences
>
>Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [[Topological Spaces|topological space]] and let $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a [[Sequences|sequence]] of points in $X$.
>
>We say that $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is **convergent** if there exists some $x \in X$ iff for each [[Topological Spaces|neighbourhood]] $N(x)$ there exists some $N_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $x_n \in N(x)$ for all $n \ge N_0$.
>
>We also say that $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ **converges to** $x$.
