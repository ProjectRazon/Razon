# Convergence

Since a [[Complex Series]] $\displaystyle \sum_{n \in \mathcal{D}} a_n$ is just a [[Complex Sequences|complex sequence]], the definitions and terminology for convergence of series is the same as those used for [[Convergence]] of sequences. What is different, however, is the notation used.

>[!NOTATION] Notation: Convergence of Complex Series

>If $\displaystyle \sum_{n \in \mathcal{D}} a_n$ [[Convergence|converges]] to $L$, we write

>$$
>\sum_{n \in \mathcal{D}} a_n = L

>Instead of calling $L$ the limit of $\displaystyle \sum_{n \in \mathcal{D}} a_n$, we usually say it is its **value**.

## Absolute Convergence

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Absolute Convergence of Complex Series
>
>A [[Complex Series]] $\displaystyle \sum_{n \in \mathcal{D}} a_n$ **converges absolutely** to $L$ iff the [[Real Series]] $\displaystyle \sum_{n \in \mathcal{D}} |a_n|$ [[Convergence|converges]] to $L$.

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Absolute Convergence $\implies$ Convergence
>
>If a [[Complex Series]] is [[Convergence#absolute convergence|absolutely convergent]] towards $L \in \mathbb{C}$, then it is also [[Convergence|convergent]] towards $L$.

## Conditional Convergence

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Conditional Convergence
>
>A [[Complex Series]] is **conditionally convergent** iff it is [[Convergence|convergent]] but not [[Convergence#absolute convergence|absolutely convergent]].

# Criteria for Convergence and Divergence

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Test for Divergence
>
>Let $\displaystyle \sum_{n \in \mathcal{D}} a_n$ be a [[Complex Series]].
>
>If the [[Complex Sequences|sequence]] $(a_n)_{n \in \mathcal{D}}$ [[Convergence|diverges]] or its [[Convergence|limit]] is not zero, then $\displaystyle \sum_{n \in \mathcal{D}} a_n$ [[Convergence|diverges]].
