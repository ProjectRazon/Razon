>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Complex Power Series
>
>A **complex power series** is an [[Formal Languages|expression]] of the form
>
>$$
>\sum_{n\in \mathcal{D}} a_n (x-c)^n,
>$$
>
>where $(a_n)_{n \in \mathcal{D}}$ is a [[Complex Sequences|complex sequence]] and $c \in \mathbb{C}$.
>
>>[!INTUITION]
>>
>>By plugging in a concrete value $x^\ast \in \mathbb{C}$ for $x$, one obtains the [[Complex Series]]
>>
>>$$
>>\sum_{n \in \mathcal{D}} a_n (x^{\ast} - c)^n
>>$$
