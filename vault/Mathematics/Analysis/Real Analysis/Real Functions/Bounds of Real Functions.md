>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Upper Bound

>A real number $u \in \mathbb{R}$ is an **upper bound** of a [[Functions of the Real Numbers|real-valued function]] $f: D \to \mathbb{R}$ if

>f(x) \le u \qquad \forall x \in D

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Lower Bound
>
>A real number $l \in \mathbb{R}$ is an **upper bound** of a [[Functions of the Real Numbers|real-valued function]] $f: D \to \mathbb{R}$ if
>
>$$
>l \le f(x) \qquad \forall x \in D
>$$

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Bounded Function
>
>A [[Functions of the Real Numbers|real-valued function]] is:
>- **bounded above** if it has at least one upper bound;
>- **bounded below** if it has at least one lower bound;
>- **bounded** if it is bounded above and bounded below.
