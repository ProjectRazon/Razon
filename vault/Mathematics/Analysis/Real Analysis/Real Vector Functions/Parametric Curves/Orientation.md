title: Orientation of Parametric Curves
---

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Orientation
>
>Let $\gamma: [a;b] \to \mathbb{R}^n$ and $\varphi: [c; d] \to \mathbb{R}^n$ be [[Curves|equivalent]] [[Parametric Curve|parametric curves]].
>
>If $\gamma(a) = \varphi(c)$ and $\gamma(b) = \varphi(d)$, we say that $\gamma$ and $\varphi$ have the **same orientation** or that $\gamma$ (or $\varphi$) is **orientation-preserving**.
>
>If $\gamma(a) = \varphi(d)$ and $\gamma(b) = \varphi(c)$, we say that $\gamma$ and $\varphi$ have **opposite orientations** or that $\gamma$ (or $\varphi$) is **orientation-reversing**.
