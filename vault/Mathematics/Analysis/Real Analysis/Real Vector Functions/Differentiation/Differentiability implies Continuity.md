>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Differentiability implies Continuity
>
>Let $f: \mathcal{D} \to \mathbb{R}^n$ be a [[Functions of the Real Numbers|real vector function]] on an [[The Topology of Euclidean Space|open subset]] $\mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m$.
>
>If $f$ is [[Differentiability of Real Vector Functions|differentiable]] at $\mathbf{x}_0 \in \mathcal{D}$, then $f$ is also [[Continuity of Real Vector Functions|continuous]] there.
