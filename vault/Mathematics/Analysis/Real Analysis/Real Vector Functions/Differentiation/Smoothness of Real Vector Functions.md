>>A [[Functions of the Real Numbers|real vector function]] $f: \mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is **piecewise smooth** if $\mathcal{D}$ can be represented as a [[Disjoint Sets|disjoint]] [[Set Operations|union]] $\mathcal{D} = \mathcal{D}_1 \cup \cdots \cup \mathcal{D}_k$ of finitely many [[Sets|subsets]] $\mathcal{D}_1, \dotsc, \mathcal{D}_k$ of $\mathbb{R}^m$ such that the [[Functions|restrictions]] $f_{\mathcal{D}_1}, \dotsc, f_{\mathcal{D}_k}$ are [[Smoothness of Real Vector Functions|smooth]].
>>
>>>[!INTUITION]-
>>>
>>>Intuitively, this means that $D$ can be partitioned into finitely many parts such that $f$ is smooth on each part and is not smooth only at a finite number of points in $D$.
