>[!DEFINITION] Definition: SurfaceNormal Vector
>
>Let $s: \mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^3$ be a [[Parametric Surface]] which is [[Differentiability of Real Vector Functions|differentiable]] at $\mathbf{a}$.
>
>The **normal vector** of $s$ at $\mathbf{a}$ is the [[Real Cross Product|cross product]] of $s$'s [[Partial Derivatives of Real Vector Functions|partial derivatives]] with respect to [[Cartesian Coordinate System|Cartesian coordinates]]:

>\frac{\partial s}{\partial x}(\mathbf{a}) \times \frac{\partial s}{\partial y}(\mathbf{a})

>>[!NOTATION]-
>>
>>The normal vector is often denoted as $\mathbf{N}$ or $\mathbf{N}(\mathbf{a})$ and the [[Unit Vector|unit]] normal vector as $\mathbf{n}$.

>>The normal vector is sometimes also called just the **surface normal**.
