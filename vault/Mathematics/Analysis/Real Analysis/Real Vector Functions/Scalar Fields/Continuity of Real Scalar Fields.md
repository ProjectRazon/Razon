>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Continuity of Real Scalar Fields
>
>Let $f,g: \mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ be [[Real Scalar Field|real scalar fields]].
>
>If $f$ and $g$ are [[Continuity of Real Vector Functions|continuous]] at $\mathbf{x}_0 \in \mathcal{D}$, then so is their product $fg$.
>
>Furthermore, if $g(\mathbf{x}) \ne 0$ for all $\mathbf{x} \in \mathcal{D}$, then their quotient $f / g$ is also [[Continuity of Real Vector Functions|continuous]] at $\mathbf{x}_0$.
