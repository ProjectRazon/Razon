# The Euclidean Topology

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: The Euclidean Topology
>
>The **Euclidean topology** on the [[Structure of the Real Vector Space|real vector space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the [[index|metric topology]] induced on it by the [[Euclidean Metric]].
>
>The [[Structure of the Real Vector Space|vector space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ equipped with its [[The Topology of Euclidean Space|Euclidean topology]] is known as the $n$-dimensional **Euclidean space**.
>

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Euclidean Space is a Smooth Manifold
>
>The [[Atlases|atlas]] whose only [[index|chart]] is $(\mathbb{R}^n, \operatorname{id})$, where $\operatorname{id}$ is the [[Identity Function]] on the [[The Topology of Euclidean Space|Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$, is a [[Smooth Manifolds|smooth structure]] on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and naturally makes it a [[Smooth Manifolds|smooth manifold]].

# Open Sets

>[!INTUITION] Intuition: Open Balls in Euclidean Space
>
>Let $p \in \mathbb{R}^n$ be an element of the [[The Topology of Euclidean Space|Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$.
>
>An [[index|open ball]] $B_r(p)$ of radius $r$ around $p$ contains all $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ whose distance from $p$ is less than $r$. It is essentially an $n$-dimensional sphere which is centred at $p$ and has radius $r$.

>[!TIP] Tip: Open Sets in Euclidean Space
>
>The [[Topological Spaces|open subsets]] of the [[The Topology of Euclidean Space|Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ are precisely the following:
>- All [[The Topology of Euclidean Space|open balls]];
>- All [[Operations with Collections|unions]] of arbitrary [[Collections]] of [[The Topology of Euclidean Space|open balls]];
>- All [[Operations with Collections|intersections]] of finite [[Collections]] of [[The Topology of Euclidean Space|open balls]].

# Compactness

>[!THEOREM] Heine-Borel Theorem: Compactness in Euclidean Space

>A [[Topological Subspaces|subspace]] of the [[The Topology of Euclidean Space|Euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ is [[index|compact]] if and only if it is [[Topological Spaces|closed]] and [[Boundedness in Metric Spaces|bounded]].
