>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Polynomial Equation
>
>A **polynomial equation** over a [[index|field]] $F$ is an [[Equation]] of the form
>
>$$
>P(x_1, \cdots, x_n) = 0_F,
>$$
>
>where $P(x_1, \cdots, x_n)$ is a [[Polynomials|nonzero]] [[Polynomials|polynomial]].

>>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Solution of a Polynomial Equation
>>
>>A **solution** to the [[Polynomial Equations|polynomial equation]] $P(x_1, \cdots, x_n) = 0_F$ is an $n$-[[Tuples]] $S = (\lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_n)$ of elements from $F$ such that the [[Polynomials|value]] of $P$ at $S$ is $0_F$.
