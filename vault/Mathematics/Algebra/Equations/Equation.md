>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Equation
>
>Let $X$ and $Y$ be two not necessarily unique [[Sets]] such that $Y$ has an [[Relations|equivalence relation]] $E_Y$ defined on it.
>
>An **equation** over $X$ is an [[Formal Languages|expression]] of the form
>
>$$
>f(x) = g(x),
>$$
>
>where $f,g: X \to Y$ are arbitrary [[Functions]].

>>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Solution
>>
>>A **solution** to the equation is any $x^\ast \in X$ such that $f(x^\ast) \,\, E_Y \,\, g(x^\ast)$.
