>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Row Echelon Form
>
>A [[Matrix]] $A \in F^{m \times n}$ is in **row echelon form** if:
>- All rows which contain only zeroes are at the bottom;
>- The first non-zero entry of every non-zero row, called the **pivot**, is on the right of the pivot of every row above.

>>[!NOTE]
>>
>>A single [[Matrix]] can possess more than a single row echelon form.

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Reduced Row Echelon Form

>A [[Matrix]] $A \in F^{m \times n}$ is in **reduced row echelon form** if:
>- It is in row echelon form;
>- All pivots are equal to 1;
>- All entries above each pivot are zeroes.
