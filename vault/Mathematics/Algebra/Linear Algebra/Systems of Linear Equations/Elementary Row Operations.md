>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Elementary Row Operations
>
>**Elementary row operations** are the following manipulations which can be done on a [[System of Linear Equations]] without changing its solutions:
>
>- Exchanging two rows (row swap)
>- Multiplying a row by a constant $\lambda \ne 0$ 
>- Adding a non-zero multiple of one row to another row
>

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Elementary Matrix
>
>Each elementary row operation can by represented as the [[Matrix Product]] of the [[Augmented Matrix]] $(A|\vec{b}) \in K^{m \times n}$ of a [[System of Linear Equations]] with a [[Matrix]] $E$, which is obtained by applying the row operation to the [[Identity Matrix]] $I_m$.
