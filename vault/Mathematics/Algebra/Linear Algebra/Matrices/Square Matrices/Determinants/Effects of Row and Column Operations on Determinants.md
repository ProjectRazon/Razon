>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Effects of Row and Column Operations on Determinants
>
>For any [[Square Matrix]] $A \in F^{n \times n}$:
>
>- Swapping two rows or two columns changes the algebraic sign of $A$'s [[Determinant]].
>- Multiplying a single row or a single column by $\lambda \in F$ results in $A$'s [[Determinant]] being multiplied by $\lambda$.
>- Adding a non-zero multiple of one row or column to another row or column has no effect on $A$'s [[Determinant]].
