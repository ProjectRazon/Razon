>Let $A \in F^{n \times n}$ be a [[Square Matrix]].
>
>A non-zero [[Column Vector|vector]] $\vec{v} \in F^n$ is an **eigenvector** of a $A$ if there is some $\lambda \in F$ such that

>A\vec{v} = \lambda \vec{v}

>
>In this case, we also say that $\vec{v}$ belongs to the [[Eigenvalue]] $\lambda$.

>>An [[Eigenvector]] can only belong to a single [[Eigenvalue]].
