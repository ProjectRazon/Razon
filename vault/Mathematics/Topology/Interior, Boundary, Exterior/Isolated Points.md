>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Isolated Point

>Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [[Topological Spaces|topological space]] and let $S$ be a [[Sets|subset]] of $X$.
>
>A point $p \in S$ is an **isolated point** of $S$ iff $p$ has a [[Topological Spaces|neighbourhood]] $N(p)$ which does not contain any other points of $S$.

>N(p) \cap S = \{p\}
