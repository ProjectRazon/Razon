# Local Homeomorphisms

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Local Homeomorphism
>
>Let $(X, \tau_X)$ and $(Y,\tau_Y)$ be [[Topological Spaces]].
>
>A **local homeomorphism** is a [[Functions|function]] $f: X \to Y$ such that every $x \in X$ has an [[Topological Spaces|open]] [[Topological Spaces|neighbourhood]] $O$ whose [[Functions|image]] $f(O)$ is [[Topological Spaces|open]] and for which the [[Functions|restriction]] $f\big|_O$ is a [[index|homeomorphism]] between the [[Topological Subspaces|subspaces]] $O$ and $f(O)$.
