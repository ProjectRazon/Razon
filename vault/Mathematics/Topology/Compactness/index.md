# Covers

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Cover
>
>Let $X$ be a [[Sets|set]].
>
>A [[Collections|collection]] $\mathcal{C}$ of [[Sets|subsets]] of $X$ is a **cover** of $X$ iff $X$ is a [[Sets|subset]] of the [[Operations with Collections|union]] of $\mathcal{C}$.

>X \subseteq \bigcup \mathcal{C}

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Subcover
>
>Let $X$ be a [[Sets|set]] and let $\mathcal{C}$ be a [[index#covers|cover]] of $X$.
>
>A **subcover** of $\mathcal{C}$ is [[Collections|subcollection]] of $\mathcal{C}$ which is still a [[index#covers|cover]] of $X$.

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Open Cover
>
>Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [[Topological Spaces|topological space]].
>
>A [[index#covers|cover]] of $X$ is an **open cover** iff all of its elements are [[Topological Spaces|open sets]].

# Compactness

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Compactness of a Topological Space
>
>A [[Topological Spaces|topological space]] is **compact** iff each of its [[index#covers|open covers]] has a finite [[index#covers|subcover]].

>>[!NOTE] Note: Compactness of a Subset
>>
>>A [[Sets|subset]] of a [[Topological Spaces|topological space]] is called compact iff it is [[index#compactness|compact]] as a [[Topological Subspaces|subspace]].
