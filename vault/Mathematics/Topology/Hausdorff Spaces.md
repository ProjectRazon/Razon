# Hausdorff Spaces

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Hausdorff Space
>
>A [[Topological Spaces|topological space]] $(X,\tau)$ is a **Hausdorff space** iff for all distinct points $p_1,p_2 \in X$ there are [[Disjoint Sets|disjoint]] [[Topological Spaces|neighbourhoods]] $N(p_1)$ of $p_1$ and $N(p_2)$ of $p_2$.
>
>>[!NOTE]
>>
>>Hausdorff spaces are also known as **$T_2$ spaces**.

## Properties

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Closedness of Compact Hausdorff Subspaces
>
>Every [[index#^compactness-of-a-topological-space]] [[Topological Subspaces|subspace]] of a [[Hausdorff Spaces|Hausdorff space]] $(H,\tau_H)$ is [[Topological Spaces|closed]] in $(H,\tau_H)$.

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Finite Subsets of Hausdorff Spaces are Closed
>
>Every finite [[Sets|subset]] of a [[Hausdorff Spaces|Hausdorff space]] is [[Topological Spaces|closed]].
>
>>[!PROOF]-
>>
>>Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [[Hausdorff Spaces|Hausdorff space]].
>>
>>Let $\{p_0\}$ contain only the point $p_0 \in X$. By definition, given any other point $p \in X$, there exists [[Disjoint Sets|disjoint]] [[Topological Spaces|neighbourhoods]] $N(p_0)$ and $N(p)$.

>[!THEOREM] Theorem: Limits of Sequences in Hausdorff Spaces
>
>If a [[Sequences|sequence]] $(x_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of points in a [[Hausdorff Spaces|Hausdorff space]] is [[Convergence of Sequences|convergent]], then it has a unique [[Limit of a Sequence|limit]].
