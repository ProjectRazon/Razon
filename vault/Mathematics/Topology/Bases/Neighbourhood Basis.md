>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Neighbourhood Basis
>
>Let $(X, \tau)$ be a [[Topological Spaces|topological space]] and let $p \in X$.
>
>A [[Collections|collection]] $\mathcal{B}$ of [[Topological Spaces|neighbourhoods]] of $p$ is a **neighbourhood basis** of $(X, \tau)$ at $p$ iff for each [[Topological Spaces#^neighbourhood-of-a-point]] $N(p)$, there exists some [[Topological Spaces|neighbourhood]] $B(p) \in \mathcal{B}$ such that $B(p) \subseteq N(p)$.
