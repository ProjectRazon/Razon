>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Cardinality Comparisons
>
>Let $A$ and $B$ be two [[Sets]].
>
>We say that:
>- the [[index|cardinality]] of $A$ is **equal** to the [[index|cardinality]] of $B$, written as $|A| = |B|$, if there is a [[Injections, Surjections and Bijections|bijection]] from $A$ to $B$;
>- the [[index|cardinality]] of $A$ is **less than or equal** to the [[index|cardinality]] of $B$, written as $|A| \le |B|$, if there is an [[Injections, Surjections and Bijections|injection]] between $A$ and $B$;
>- the [[index|cardinality]] of $A$ is **less than** the [[index|cardinality]] of $B$, written as $|A| \lt |B|$, if there is an [[Injections, Surjections and Bijections|injection]] but no [[Injections, Surjections and Bijections|bijection]] from $A$ to $B$.
