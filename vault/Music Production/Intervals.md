# Intervals

An **interval** in music is the ratio of the frequencies of two [[Sound and Waveforms#Pitch|pitches]]. 

>[!NOTATION]
>
>Most commonly, intervals are denoted as reduced fractions with the colon sign such as $2:1$, $5:4$, $4:7$ etc. However, it is also possible to denote them by their decimal value, obtained after the division of the numbers such as $2$, $1.25$, $0.5$, etc. The latter is actually the only option when the ratio is an irrational number.

Depending on how the [[Sound and Waveforms|sounds]] are arranged temporally, we distinguish two types of intervals:
- **harmonic intervals** - we say that the interval between two [[Sound and Waveforms#Pitch|pitches]] is harmonic whenever they are playing simultaneously;
- **melodic intervals** - we say that the interval between two [[Sound and Waveforms#Pitch|pitches]] is melodic whenever they are to be played sequentially, one after the other.

Furthermore, we distinguish two types of melodic intervals:
- **ascending intervals** - an interval is ascending whenever it is a number greater than $1$, i.e. the second [[Sound and Waveforms#Pitch|pitch]] has a higher frequency than the first;
- **descending intervals** - an interval is descending whenever it is a number between $0$ and $1$, i.e. the second [[Sound and Waveforms#Pitch|pitch]] has a lower frequency than the first.

There are two fundamental [[Intervals]] which are crucial for all of music:

>A **(perfect) unison** is the [[Intervals|interval]] between two identical [[Sound and Waveforms#Pitch|pitches]], i.e. the [[Intervals|interval]] with value $1:1$.

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Octave
>
>An **(perfect) octave** is the [[Intervals|interval]] between two [[Sound and Waveforms#Pitch|pitches]] where the frequency of one of the [[Sound and Waveforms#Pitch|pitches]] is exactly double the frequency of the other, i.e. the [[Intervals|interval]] with value $2:1$.

# Naming

For us humans, working directly with numbers is unintuitive and confusing. This is why we have devised a more comprehensible naming system for [[Intervals]].
