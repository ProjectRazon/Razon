# Introduction

The **Serbo-Croatian** language also known as **Bosnian-Croatian-Montenegrin-Serbian** (BCMS) is the primary language of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia. Despite being standardized by different entities in each country, the four standard varieties of BCMS - Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin and Serbian - are all mutually intelligible. In fact, the distinction between the four varieties stems more from sociopolitical debates rather than from their linguistic idiosyncracies.
