# Orthography

The [[Writing Systems|writing system]] used by [[index|Modern Greek]] is an [[Writing Systems#Alphabets|alphabet]] consisting of 23 letters.

|Letter|Greek Name|English Name|Pronunciation|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|Α α|άλφα|alpha|/a/|
|Β β|βήτα|beta|/v/|
|Γ γ|γάμμα|gamma|/ɣ/ before /a/, /o/, /u/ </br> /ʝ/ before /e/, /i/|
|Δ δ|δέλτα|delta|/ð/|
|Ε ε|έψιλον|epsilon|/e/|
|Ζ ζ|ζήτα|zeta|/z/|
|Η η|ήτα|eta|/i/|
|Θ θ|θήτα|theta|/θ/|
|Ι ι|ιώτα|iota|/i/, /ç/, /ʝ/, /ɲ/|
|Κ κ|κάππα|kappa|/k/ before /a/, /o/, /u/ </br> /c/ before /e/, /i/|
|Λ λ|λάμδα|lambda|/l/|
|Μ μ|μυ|mu|/m/|
|Ν ν|νυ|nu|/n/|
|Ξ ξ|ξι|xi|/ks/|
|Ο ο|όμικρον|omicron|/o/|
|Π π|πι|pi|/p/|
|Ρ ρ|ρο|rho|/ɾ/|
|Σ σ ς|σίγμα|sigma|/z/ before β, γ, μ </br> /s/ otherwise|
|Τ τ|ταυ|tau|/t/|
|Υ υ|ύψιλον|upsilon|/i/|
|Χ χ|χι|chi|/x/ before /a/, /o/, /u/ </br> /ç/ before /e/, /i/|
|Ψ ψ|ψι|psi|/ps/|
|Ω ω|ωμέγα|omega|/o/|

>[!NOTE] Note: The Letter Sigma
>
>The third form of the letter sigma (ς) is used only when sigma appears at the end of a word.

# Diacritics

The acute accent `´` is used to mark stressed syllables in polysyllabic words and is placed on the vowel of said syllables. If the vowel is an uppercase letter, then the accent is placed up and to the left of it. If the letter is lowercase, then the accent is placed on top of it. In [[Orthography and Phonology#Digraphs|digraphs]], the second letter takes the accent. 

>[!NOTE] Note: Multiple Accents
>
>Words with four or more syllables may have multiple stressed and thus accented syllables when followed by an unstressed word.
>

>[!EXAMPLE]- Example: Acute Accent for Stress
>
>είμαι /'i.me̞/
>
>αύριο /'av.ɾi.o/
>

The acute accent can also appear in monosyllabic words to distinguish between words which would otherwise be written the same.

>[!EXAMPLE]- Example: Acute Accent as Distinguisher
>
>πώς (how?, what?) <-> πως (that)
>
>ή (or) <-> η (the)
>

The diaeresis `¨` is used to indicate that two consecutive letters should *not* be treated as a [[Orthography and Phonology#Digraphs|digraph]]. It is placed on the second letter.

# Phonology

In modern Greek, there is a one-to-one correspondence between each [[Orthography and Phonology|letter]] and the sound it makes with very few exceptions.

>[!IMPORTANT] Important: The letter σ
>
>When letter σ precedes one of β, γ, δ, μ, ν, ρ, then it is pronounced as /z/. This happens even at word boundaries, meaning that a word ending in ς precedes a word starring with one of the aforementioned letters.
>
>>[!EXAMPLE]-
>>
>>σβήνω /zvino/
>>
>>κόσμος /kozmos/
>>
>>τους δύο /tuz ðio/
>>
>

>[!IMPORTANT] Important: /n p/ -> /mb/, /n t/ -> /nd/, /n k/ -> /ŋg/
>
>When a word is supposed to end in /n/ and the next one is supposed to start with /p/, the glide between them is pronounced simply as /mb/. Similarly, /n t/ becomes /n d/ and /n k/ turns into /ŋg/.
>
>>[!EXAMPLE]-
>>
>>τον πόνο /tom.'bo.no/
>>
>>τον τόνο /ton.'do.no/
>>
>>την καρδιά /tiŋ.gaɾ.'ðia/
>>
>

## Digraphs

Certain combinations of letters are pronounced differently from the normal way their constituants are pronounced.

|Digraph|Pronunciation|
|:--:|:--:|
|ΑΙ, αι |/e̞/|
|ΕΙ, ει </br> ΟΙ, οι </br> ΥΙ, υι|/i/|
|ΑΥ, αυ|/av/ before vowel or voiced consonant </br> /af/ otherwise|
|ΕΥ, ευ|/ev/ before vowel or voiced consonant </br> /ef/ otherwise|
|ΗΥ, ηυ|/iv/ before vowel or voiced consonant </br> /if/ otherwise|
|ΟΥ, ου|/u/|
|ΓΓ, γγ|/ŋɡ/ but often reduced to /ɡ/ in informal speech|
|ΓΚ, γκ|/ɡ/ at the start of a word and in some loanwords </br> /ŋɡ/ otherwise, but often reduced to /ɡ/ in informal speech|
|ΓΞ, γξ|/ŋks/|
|ΓΧ, γχ|/ŋx/ before /a/, /o/, /u/ </br> /ɲç/ before /e/, /i/|
|Μπ, μπ|/b/ at the start of a word and in some loanwords </br> /mb/ otherwise, but often reduced to /b/ in informal speech|
|Ντ, ντ|/d/ at the start of a word and in some loanwords </br> /nd/ otherwise, but often reduced to /d/ in informal speech|
|ΤΖ, τζ|/d͡z/|

# Phonology

## Vowels

[[./index|Modern Greek]] has five [[TODO|vowel]] [[TODO|phonemes]].

</tr>
</table>

The [[TODO|vowel]] [[TODO|phonemes]] are actualized by the following [[../../Linguistics/Phonetics/index#Introduction|phones]]:
- /a/ as the [[TODO|near-open central vowel]] [ɐ];
- /i/ as the [[TODO|close front unrounded vowel]] [i];
- /u/ as the [[TODO|close back rounded vowel]] [u];
- /e/ as the [[TODO|mid front unrounded vowel]] [e̞];
- /o/ as the [[TODO|mid back rounded vowel]] [o̞]. 

There is no distinction between long and short vowels.

## Consonants



## Stress Accent

Similarly to English, [[./index|Modern Greek]] has a stress accent system in which every word has a syllable pronounced slightly louder and longer than the others.

The stress of a word always falls on one of its last three syllables. In all polysyllabic words, the stressed syllable is marked by an [[Orthography and Phonology#Diacritics|acute accent]]. Additionally, some monosyllabic words can also bear an [[Orthography and Phonology#Diacritics|acute accent]] which serves to distinguish between [[TODO|homophones]].
