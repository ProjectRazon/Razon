# Introduction

Verbs in [[index|Bulgarian]] inflect for person, number, aspect, tense and mood. 
They have no infinitives. In dictionaries, verbs are listed by their first-person singular present simple form and their [[Verbs#Conjugation|conjugation]].

Bulgarian verbs fall into three [[TODO|conjugations]] based on the ending of their third person singular present simple tense:
- First-conjugation verbs end in *-е*;
- Second-conjugation verbs end in *-и*;
- Third-conjugation verbs end in *-а* / *-я*.

To obtain the stem of a verb, remove the ending of its conjugation from the third person singular present simple tense.

# Aspect

[[index|Bulgarian]] verbs have the grammatical category of **aspect**:
- **Imperfective** verbs (**глаголи от несвършен вид**) represent actions which are in progress, habitual or repeated.
- **Perfective** verbs (**глаголи от свършен вид**) represent actions which are viewed as a complete whole, without reference to duration or repetitiveness.
