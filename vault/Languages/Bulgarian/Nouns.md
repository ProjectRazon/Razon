# Gender

Nouns in Bulgarian can take on one of three genders - masculine, feminine and neuter. It is not possible to determine the gender of noun solely by looking at it, but most nouns do exhibit certain patterns depending on their ending.

# Number

Nouns in Bulgarian can be either **singular** or **plural**. Unlike in English, however, building the plural form of a noun from its singular form is not as easy as just adding a letter or two. The ending for the plural form of a noun can depend on several factors such as the noun's singular ending, its gender and its number of syllables. 

## Masculine Nouns

There is no fool-proof rule for determining the plural form of a masculine from only its singular form, so each masculine nouns must be learned with both its singular and plural forms. However, there are certain patterns which most nouns follow and can make the process easier.



### Count Form

Masculine nouns which do *not* signify persons and end in a consonant have an additional plural form, known as **count form** which is used in certain situations.

>[!IMPORTANT] Important
>
>If the noun signifies a person, then it does *not* have a count form and always uses its normal plural form.
>

This form is built by appending either "-а" or "-я" to a noun's singular form. Almost all nouns use "-а", however, if a noun's singular form ends in "-й", its count form is built by replacing "-й" with "-я" because й + а = я. If the noun ends in "-тел", then its count form is obtained by appending "-я" instead of "-а". Some other nouns such as "кон" also use "-я" for their count form, but they are very rare.

>[!EXAMPLE]-
>
>народ (nation) -> народ**а**, театър (theatre) -> театър**а**, бряг (coast) -> бряг**а**
>
>усилвател (amplifier) -> усилвател**я**, ключодържател (keychain) -> ключодържател**я**
>
>кон (horse) -> кон**я**, път (road) -> път**я**
>

>[!TIP] Tip: Stress in the Count Form
>
>The stress in the count form of a noun *never* ends on the last syllable.

The count form is used only after [[TODO|cardinal numbers]] ("два", "сто и един", "хиляда и сто"), combinations from such numbers ("четири-пет", "седем-осем") and the [[TODO|adverbs]] "колко", "колкото", "толкова" and "няколко".

>[!EXAMPLE]-
>
>Би ли ми дал онези *два* стол**а**? (Would you give me those two chairs?)
>
>*Четирите* път**я** са свързани с кръгово. (The four roads are joined by a roundabout.)
>
>Колко крак**а** имат паяците? (How many legs do spiders have?)
>
>Трябват ми още *няколко* час**а**, за да приключа с работата. (I need a few more hours to finish the work).
>

>[!WARNING] Warning: Exceptions with "колко" and "толкова"
>
>If "колко" or "толкова" are used to amplify something and do not express a particular quantity, then the normal plural form is used. This usually happens in exclamative sentences.
>
>>[!EXAMPLE]-
>>
>>*Колко* хубави кон**я** имаш? (How many beautiful horses do you have?)
>>
>>*Колко* хубави кон**е** имаш! (You have such beautiful horses!)
>>
>>Не очаквах *толкова* подаръ**ци**! (I did not expect so many presents!)
>>
>

The count form is also used if there are other modifiers between the number / adverb and the noun. However, if one of these words is a [[TODO|preposition]] or [[TODO|verb]] or one of "и повече" / "или повече" and "и по-малко" / "или по-малко", then the normal plural form is used.

>[!EXAMPLE]-
>
>*Трите* най-големи парк**а** в страната имат обща площ над хиляда. кв. км. (The three biggest parks in the country have a total area of more than a thousand square kilometers.)
>
>БДЖ закупи *няколко* нови влак**а**. (BDZ bought a few new trains.)
>
>Не е известно *колко* от старите телефон**и** имат този дефект. (It is unknown how many of the old phones have this defect).
>
>*Четири* са *големите* пожар**и**, които изпепелиха селото. (The big fires which burned the village to the ground are four).
>
>*Петдесет хиляди* или повече долар**и** ще са нужни за реновирането на апартамента. (Fifty thousand dollars or more will be necessary for the refurbishment of the apartment.)
>

If the word is one of "двойка", "тройка", etc., "дузина", "чифт", or does not name a specific number ("стотици, десетки, хиляди"), then the normal plural form is used.

>[!EXAMPLE]-
>
>Китай инвестира *милиарди* долар**и** в този проект. (China is investing billions of dollars in this project).
