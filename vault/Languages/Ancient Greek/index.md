# Introduction

**Ancient Greek** refers to the language spoken in Ancient Greece between 1500 BC and 300 BC. Throughout this period, the language underwent several stages and had many dialects. 

What is commonly referred to by "Ancient Greek" or "Classical Greek" nowadays (and what is meant by these terms here) is the Attic Greek dialect spoken in Athens between 500 BC and 300 BC. It is the language of Socrates, Plato, Aristotle and many other philosophers and playwrights.
