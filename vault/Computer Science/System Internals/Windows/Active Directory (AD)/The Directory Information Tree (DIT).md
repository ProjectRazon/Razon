# The Directory Information Tree (DIT)

All data in a given Active Directory environment is stored in a database called the *Directory Information Tree (DIT)* or *data store*. Every [[Domain Controllers|Domain Controller]] maintains a partial copy of the data store containing all the relevant information for the domain the controller belongs to. 

By default, the database is stored by domain controllers in `C:\Windows\NTDS\ntds.dit` and it has three main tables.

## The Hidden Table

The hidden table contains only a single row with information used by Active Directory to configuration-related information in the data table. Most importantly, this table holds a pointer to the domain controller's NTDS Settings object in the data table.

## The Data Table

Most of the data in the AD environment is stored in the data table. Every attribute defined in the Schema is represented by a column and every object has a row dedicated to it. The values of the object's attributes are stored in the cells under the corresponding columns and if the object does not have a particular attribute, then that cell is left empty.

In addition to a column for each attribute, the data table contains a few special columns. 

The first column is the *distinguished name tag (DNT)* which identifies each row (i.e. object) in the table. The DNT is *not* replicated which means that each object is likely to have a different DNT on different domain controllers. Furthermore, a domain controller is not allowed to reuse DNTs even after the object they refer to has been deleted. Since there can be at most $2^{31} - 255$ DNTs, a domain controller may eventually be unable to create new objects.

The *parent DNT (PDNT)* column stores the DNT of the object's direct parent. When the object is moved, its PDNT is automatically update to reflect its new parent.

The *NCDNT* column contains the DNT of the [[Naming Contexts]] the object belongs to, which illustrates that directory partitions are simply logical divisions and are not reflected "physically" (i.e. by creating separate folders for them or something similar).

The *Ancestors* columns stores the DNTs of the all of the object's ancestors (from the root down to the object itself) which essentially represents the hierarchy.
