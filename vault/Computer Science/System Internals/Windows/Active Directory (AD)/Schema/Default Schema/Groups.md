# Introduction

Groups are instances of the AD [[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/c-group|Group]] class. They provide the means to mass assign permissions to users, making administration a lot easier. The administrator assigns a set of privileges to the group and they will be inherited by any user who joins it.

Groups have two essential characteristics - type and scope.

## Group Type

The group type identifies the group's purpose and must be chosen upon creation of the group. There are two types of groups.

*Security groups* are best suited precisely for the purpose described above - mass assignment of permissions to users. 

*Distributions groups* are a bit different - they are unable to assign any permissions and are really only used by email applications for the distribution of messages to their members. They resemble mailing lists and can be auto-filled in the recipient field when sending emails using Microsoft Outlook.

## Group Scope

There are three possible group scopes and once again must be selected upon creation of the group. The group scope determines the level of permissions that can be assigned via the group.

*Domain Local* groups can only be used to manage permissions only regarding resources within the domain that the group belongs to. Whilst such groups cannot be used in other domains, they *can* contain users from other domains. Additionally, nesting of domain local groups is allowed within other domain local groups but not within global ones.

*Global* groups allow access to resources in a different domain from the one they belong to, although they may only contain users from their origin domain. Nesting of global groups is allowed both in other global groups and local groups.

*Universal* groups allow permissions management across all domains within the same forest. They are stored in the Global Catalog and any change made directly to them triggers forest-wide replication. To avoid unnecessary replications, administrators are advised to keep users and computers in global groups which are themselves stored in universal groups.

It is also possible to change the scope of a group under certain conditions:
- A global group can be promoted to a universal group if it is not part of another global group.
- A domain local group can be promoted to a universal group if it does not contain any other domain local groups.
- A universal group can be demoted to a global group if it does not contain any other universal groups.
- A universal group can be freely demoted to a domain local group.

# Default Groups

Some built-in groups are automatically created when an AD environment is set up. These groups have specific purposes and *cannot* contain other groups - only users.
