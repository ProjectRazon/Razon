# Introduction

A user in AD stores information about an employee or contractor who works for the organisation. These objects are instances of the [[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/c-user|User class]]. User objects are leaf objects, since they do not contain any other objects.

Every user is considered a security principal and has its own SID and GUID. Additionally, user objects can have numerous different attributes such as display name, email address, last login time, etc - well in excess of 800.

# Domain Users

Domain Users in AD are the ones who are capable of accessing resources in the Active Directory environment. These users can log into any host on the network. All domain users have 5 essential naming attributes as well as many others:
