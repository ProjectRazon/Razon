# Introduction

**Linux** is an umbrella term used to refer to the family of [[TODO|operating systems]] which are based on the Linux kernel. The kernel is a fundamental component of every operating system and provides crucial functionality for interfacing with hardware and files. However, it is quite limited and lacks any software which is useful to us humans. As a user, you do not interact with the kernel directly. Instead, you interact with software which in turn relies on the functionality provided by the kernel.

[[TODO|Operating systems]] which use the Linux kernel are known as **Linux distributions**. Since the Linux kernel is free and open-source (its code can be found [here](https://github.com/torvalds/linux)), every individual or organization can build its own distribution and many have done so. In fact, Linux distributions are the most widely-used [[TODO|operating systems]] in the world and run on any type of device ranging from mobile phones (yes, Android is a Linux distribution) to servers.

# History

The Linux kernel was started as a personal project in 1991 by a Finnish student named Linus Torvalds. His wanted to create a new, free operating system kernel. Since then, the Linux kernel has evolved from a few files written in C to a massive codebase with over 23 million lines of source code and is found literally everywhere.

# Philosophy

Linux's philosophy is rooted in simplicity, modularity and openness. As such, it can be quite different from what you might be used to with [[../Windows/index|Windows]]. There are few fundamental principles which govern the architecture behind Linux:
- Everything in Linux is represented by a file in the file system, including external devices, configurations, software, etc.
- Linux prefers small, single-purpose programs which can be chained with one another to complete complex tasks.
- Although pretty much all modern can and do use graphical user interfaces, the primary means of interacting with Linux is through text-based commands.

The aforementioned principles are what makes Linux suitable for many different purposes and explain its the wide adoption it has.
