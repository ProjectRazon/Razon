>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Time Complexity
>
>The **time complexity** $T(n)$ of an algorithm is the number of atomic operations that the algorithm performs before completion when given an input of length $n$. We say that the algorithm runs in $T(n)$ time.

>>The time complexity $T(n)$ is a function which depends on the input's length. An *atomic operation* is the most basic operation which the algorithm can perform and is assumed to always take a constant amount of time to run, which is why they serve as the units in which time complexity is measured.
