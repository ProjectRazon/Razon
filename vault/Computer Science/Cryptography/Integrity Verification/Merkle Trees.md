# Introduction

Consider the case where you upload a file $x$ to a server and later want to retrieve it. How can you be sure that the file $x'$ is the same as the file you originally uploaded? Perhaps someone hacked the server in the meantime and tampered with the file - how can you detect this? 

Well, a (gormless) solution would be to simply store a copy of $x$ on your local machine and then check if the file $x'$ returned from the server matches your local copy. For one, this verification might take a while to finish depending on the size of the file, and, secondly, having to maintain a local copy defeats the entire purpose of using the server for storage.

Another thing you could do is to [[index|hash]] the file with a [[Security Definitions|collision resistant]] hash function and store only its digest $h = H(x)$. Later on, when retrieving the file from the server, you can simply check if the hash $H(x')$ of the server's file matches the hash $h$ which you stored on your system. This is indeed an excellent solution for single files, but what about the case when multiple files are involved?

# Merkle Trees

Merkle trees provide a way to solve this very problem. More generally, whenever one has $q$ different components that comprise some object $o$, a Merkle tree can be used to verify both the integrity of the entire object $o$ as well as that of its individual components. 

Suppose you have $q$ different files $x_1, ..., x_q$ where $q$ is a power of 2 for simplicity (otherwise you can just use additional dummy files until $q$ becomes a power of 2). The first step is to hash each of the files $x_1, ..., x_q$ to obtain their corresponding hashes $h_1, ..., h_q$. Next, divide the hashes into pairs according to their adjacency - $(h_1, h_2), (h_3,h_4), ..., (h_{q-1}, h_q)$. Concatenate the elements of each pair and hash the results. This process is repeated until there is only a single hash $h_{\text{root}}$ left which is what you store on your machine.

Later, when you are retrieving a specific file from the remote host, the server will send you the file $x_i'$ together with the hashes necessary to calculate $h_{\text{root}}'$. For example, if you are requesting $x_3$, then the server will return a file $x_3'$ together with the hashes $h_4'$, $h_{1-2}'$, and $h_{5-8}'$. You are going to hash $x_3'$ to obtain $h_3' = H(x_3')$ and then use this with $h_4'$ to compute $h_{3-4}' = H(h_3'||h_4')$. This can now be used to calculate $h_{1-4}' = H(h_{1-2}'||h_{3-4}')$ and subsequently $h_{\text{root}}' = H(h_{1-4}'||h_{5-8}')$. If this new root hash $h_{\text{root}}'$, which is based on the server's information, matches the root hash $h_{\text{root}}$, which you computed when uploading the files, then you know that the file has not been tampered with!
