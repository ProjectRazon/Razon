# Introduction

Cryptography facilitates the secure communication between different parties. However, sometimes the meaning of "security" changes. It is often the case that we are not so much concerned with the contents of the message being exposed to an adversary than we are concerned with whether the party sending the message really are who they say and whether or not the message was modified by an adversary somewhere along the way.

>Suppose that a bank receives a request to transfer 10,000€ from Alice's account to Eve's. The bank has to consider two things:

>1. Is the request authentic? I.e., was it really Alice who issued the request?
>2. Is the request unaltered? I.e., did the request get from Alice's computer to the bank's server without being modified by a an adversary?

>It maybe the case that Eve is pretending to be Alice and it is she who sent the request. Or perhaps Alice really did want to transfer money to someone, say Bob, but Eve intercepted the request and changed the recipient (and maybe even the transfer amount).

Essentially, we are more interested in protecting the message's *integrity* rather its *security*.

# Message Authentication Codes

Message authentication codes provide a way to do just that. They allow Alice to prove that she really did send the request and they also allow the bank to verify that the request originally sent by Alice was received by the bank unmodified. MACs achieve this by using *tags*. Whenever Alice sends a request, she also generates a tag using a secret key that only she and the bank know. The message itself is also used in the creation of the tag which allows the bank to then use the message and tag it receives together with the secret key in order to verify that the message was sent by the correct party and was not modified along the way.

![[res/MAC Mechanism.svg]]

The mechanism behind MACs is pretty clever and solves both of the bank's conundrums. If Eve wants to pretend to be Alice, then Eve needs Alice's secret key to sign messages as her. Since the bank also uses Alice's key, if Eve uses any other key, the tag she sends to the bank will be deemed invalid and the request will be discarded. Similarly, if Eve intercepts a message signed by Alice and modifies it, she still needs to have Alice's key in order to sign the modified message in her name.

>A *message authentication code (MAC)* is a pair of efficient algorithms $\textit{Sign}(key: \textbf{str}, message: \textbf{str}) \to \textbf{str}$ and $\textit{Verify}(key: \textbf{str}, message: \textbf{str}, tag: \textbf{str}) \to \textbf{bit}$ where $\textit{Sign}$ takes as input a key $k$ and a message $m$ and produces a tag $\tau \in \{0,1\}^*$, while $\textit{Verify}$ takes a key, a message and a tag and produces a single bit:

>\textit{Verify}(k, m, \tau) \coloneqq 
\begin{cases}1, \text{ if the tag } \tau \text{ was produced using the message } m \text{ and key } k \\ 0, \text{ otherwise}\end{cases}

>>The $\textit{Sign}$ algorithm is described exactly as above - it uses the message and the secret key in order to generate a tag which can be used to authenticate the message. The $\textit{Verify}$ algorithm uses the secret key and a message to check if the tag was generated using that specific key and that specific message. If $\textit{Verify}$ outputs 1, then the message is accepted. Otherwise, the message is discarded.

For all practical purposes, the tag is much shorter than the message - we do not want to overwhelm the network channel that is used by sending unnecessarily large tags. However, this does mean that multiple messages will produce the same tag when signed with a given key $k$.

## Security

It is now time to describe what it means for a MAC system to be secure. As it turns out, the most pertinent threat model for MACs is a [[index|chosen-message attack]]. The adversary has access to some messages and their corresponding tags and they are even free to choose the messages to be signed. The adversary's goal is to then find an entirely new *valid* message-tag pair without any knowledge of the secret key.

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: CMA-Security for Message Authentication Codes
>
>A MAC system $(\textit{Sign}, \textit{Verify})$ is *CMA-secure* if for every efficient adversary $\textit{Eve}$ and any set of message-tag pairs $(m_1, \tau_1), (m_2,\tau_2), ..., (m_q, \tau_q)$ whose messages were selected by $\textit{Eve}$ and were signed with the same key $k \leftarrow_R \{0,1\}^n$ to obtain their corresponding tags, the probability that $\textit{Eve}$ can produce a new valid message-tag pair $(m, \tau)$, called an *existential forgery*, when given $(m_1, \tau_1), (m_2,\tau_2), ..., (m_q, \tau_q)$, is at most $\frac{1}{|\mathcal{K}|} + \epsilon(n)$ for some negligible $\epsilon$, i.e.
>
>$$
>\Pr_{k \leftarrow_R \mathcal{K}}[\textit{Verify}(k, m, \tau) = 1] \le \frac{1}{2^n} + \epsilon(n)
>$$
>
>>[!INTUITION]-
>>
>>The adversary $\textit{Eve}$ is free to choose the messages $m_1,m_2,...,m_q$ and is then presented with their tags $\tau_1, \tau_2, ..., \tau_q$ which are signed with the secret key $k$, i.e. $\tau_i \leftarrow \textit{Sign}(k, m_i)$. The attacker then produces a new candidate pair $(m, \tau)$, called an *existential forgery*, with the goal that this pair fools $\textit{Verify}$ when checked with the secret key $k$. The MAC system is secure if the existential forgery can fool $\textit{Verify}$ with only an extremely small advantage over $\frac{1}{2^n}$. The reason for $\frac{1}{2^n}$ here is that it represents the probability that the adversary can just guess the key $k$ that was used to sign the message-tag pairs. This is a strategy which can always be employed and we consider the MAC system secure if no other strategy can do marginally better.

Sometimes, a stronger notion of security is also used in order to take into account the scenario where the adversary might find a valid tag $\tau'$ for a valid message-tag pair $(m, \tau)$.

>[!DEFINITION] Definition: Strong Unforgeability
>
>A CMA-secure MAC system has *strong unforgeability* if for every efficient adversary $\textit{Eve}$ and any valid message-tag pair $(m, \tau)$ signed with a key $k$, the probability that $\textit{Eve}$ can find a second tag $\tau'$ such that $\textit{Verify}(k,m, \tau') = \textit{Verify}(k,m, \tau) = 1$ at most $\frac{1}{|\mathcal{K}|} + \epsilon(n)$ for some negligible $\epsilon$, i.e.

>$$
>\Pr[\textit{Verify}(k, m, \textit{Eve}(m, \tau)) = 1] \le \frac{1}{2^n} + \epsilon(n)
>$$

>>[!INTUITION]-
>>
>>Once again, $\frac{1}{2^n}$ is the probability that $\textit{Eve}$ can just guess the key which was used to sign the initial message-tag pair. Strong unforgeability entails that there is no strategy which can do marginally better than this.
>>

This stronger security notion is essential for some applications, but it can be safely ignored for others, hence why it is a separate definition. 

>[!NOTE]

>Strong unforgeability builds on top of CMA-security. No MAC system can have strong unforgeability without being CMA-secure.

### Replay Attacks
A replay attack describes the scenario where the adversary eavesdropping on the communication channel has captured a bunch of valid message-tag pairs and later sends, or *replays*, them again. Since the pairs were generated by an authentic party and are merely being resent again by a malicious actor, they will pass verification at the receiving end with no problem.

>[!EXAMPLE]-
>
>Image that Alice really does want to transfer 100€ to Bob's account, so she sends an authentic request with a valid tag to the bank. However, if Bob copies this request on its way to the bank, Bob can later pretend to be Alice by sending the exact same message with the same valid tag and the bank will think this is a legitimate request and will transfer another 100€ to Bob's account.

Message authentication codes on their own provide *no* protection mechanisms against such attacks which is why additional measures must be implemented.

# Implementing MACs

Before implementing a MAC system, it is useful to talk about the intrinsics of its $\textit{Sign}$ algorithm. The signing function can be either deterministic or non-deterministic.

If $\textit{Sign}$ is deterministic, given the same message $m$ and using the same key $k$, $\textit{Sign}(k, m) = \tau$ will always output the same tag $\tau$. This is quite useful because it means that one does not have to get particularly imaginative with the verification algorithm. The $\textit{Verify}$ function will take the received message $m_r$ and generate a tag $\tau_g = \textit{Sign}(k, m_r)$  by signing the received message with the secret key. If the generated tag $\tau_g$ matches the tag $\tau_r$ received with the message, then the message is accepted.

![[res/Deterministic MAC.svg]]

On the other hand, if the signing algorithm is non-deterministic, that means that it uses internal randomness in the signing process and so $\textit{Sign}(k, m)$ will *not* necessarily produce the same tag $\tau$ when passed the same key and message as inputs. This means that the canonical verification algorithm for deterministic MACs no longer works and we have to get more creative with $\textit{Verify}$.
