# Introduction

The block length of all practical [[index|block ciphers]] is very small, usually 64-256 bits, but messages commonly exceed 16 bytes. Therefore, we need a means of dividing a message into blocks which match the block length of the cipher used. There are numerous ways to achieve this, called *modes of operations*, and, as it turns out, not all methods are created equal.

In practice, a block cipher is never used on its own - there is always a mode of operation involved. Therefore, saying that one "encrypts something with AES" is not enough - one needs to also specify the mode of operation used, for example AES-CBC or DES-CTR.

>Using a secure block cipher is *not* enough - one needs to also use a proper mode of operation. A secure block cipher ensures that each *block* is encrypted securely, while a secure mode of operation ensures that *the entire message* is encrypted securely.
