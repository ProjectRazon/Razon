# Introduction

Data representation refers to the way that values are stored in a computer. For technical reasons, computers do not use the familiar base-10 number system but rather avail themselves of the base-2 (binary) system. Under this paradigm, numbers are represented as 1's and 0's.

# Integer Representation

When storing an integer value, there are two ways to represent it - signed and unsigned - depending on whether the value should be entirely non-negative or may also have a "-" sign. Based on the number of bits used for storing a value, the value may have a different range.

|Size|Range Size|Unsigned Range|Signed Range|
|:---:|:----------:|:--------:|:---------:|
|Byte (8 bits)|$2^8$|$[0..255]$|$[-128..+127]$|
|Word (16 bits)|$2^{16}$|$[0..65,535]$|$[-32,768..+32,767]$|
|Doubleword (32 bits)|$2^{32}$|$[0..4,294,967,295]$|$[-2,147,483,648..+2,147,483,647]$|
|Quadword (64 bits)|$2^{64}$|$[0..2^{64}-1]$|$[-2^{63}..+2^{63}-1]$|
|Double Quadword (128 bits)|$2^{128}$|$[0..2^{128} - 1]$|$[-2^{127}.. + 2^{127} - 1]$|

Unsigned integers are represented in their typical binary form. 

## Two's Complement

Signed integers are represented using two's complement. In order to convert a acquire the negative form of a number in two's complement, is two negate all of its bits and add 1 to the number. A corollary of this representation is that it adds no complexity to the addition and subtraction operations.
