# Introduction

Sections are what make up the largest part of the PE file except for all the preceding headers. Some sections have reserved names which describe their purpose. A full list can be found on [[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format|Microsoft's documentation]] under "Special Sections".

- `.text` stores the programme's executable code.
- `.data` contains initialised data.
- `.bss` holds uninitialised data.
- `.rdata` contains read-only initialised data.
- `.edata` holds export tables.
- `.idata` stores import tables.
- `.reloc` has relocation information.
- `.rsrc` contains resources used by the program such as images or icons that are embedded.
- `.tls` is thread-local storage.

# Section Header Table

The section header table lies between the Optional Header and the actual sections. Inside there is one Section Header entry for each section. Section headers are defined as follows in `<winnt.h>`:

```cpp
// Section header format.

#define IMAGE_SIZEOF_SHORT_NAME              8

typedef struct _IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER {
    BYTE    Name[IMAGE_SIZEOF_SHORT_NAME];
    union {
            DWORD   PhysicalAddress;
            DWORD   VirtualSize;
    } Misc;
    DWORD   VirtualAddress;
    DWORD   SizeOfRawData;
    DWORD   PointerToRawData;
    DWORD   PointerToRelocations;
    DWORD   PointerToLinenumbers;
    WORD    NumberOfRelocations;
    WORD    NumberOfLinenumbers;
    DWORD   Characteristics;
} IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER, *PIMAGE_SECTION_HEADER;
```

`Name` is a byte array which holds the section name. Due to its size, section names are limited to 8 characters in length, however, it is possible to circumvent this in non-executable PEs by using a string table.

`Misc` - `PhysicalAddress` or `VirtualSize`, is a union field, meaning that it is either one or the other of its member fields. It represents the total size of the section when loaded into memory.

For executable images, `VirtualAddress` holds the offset from the beginning of the image to the beginning of the section in memory. For object files it contains the address of the section before relocations are applied.

`SizeOfRawData` stores the size of the section *on disk* and may be different from `VirtualSize`. This field must a multiple of `IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER.FileAlignment`. If the section size is less than this value, then the section gets padded and this field is rounded to `IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER.FileAlignment`. However, upon loading into memory, the section no longer is required to obey the file alignment and so only its contents are loaded. Therefore, `SizeOfRawData` will be less than `VirtualSize`. It is possible for the opposite to happen as well. For example, no space will be allocated on disk for uninitialised data, however, the section will be expanded during load-time to reserve space for this data.

`PointerToRawData` is a pointer to the first page of the section. For executables, it must be a multiple of `IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER.FileAlignment`.

`PointerToRelocations` is a pointer to the beginning of the relocations for this section. For executables, this is set to 0.

`PointerToLineNumbers` is pointer to the beginning of COFF line-number entries for the section. Since COFF debugging information is deprecated, this field holds 0.

`NumberOfRelocations` stores the number of relocation entries for this section and is set to 0 for executable images.

`NumberOfLinenumbers` is another deprecated field, which stores 0, and represents the number of COFF line-number entries for the section.

`Characteristics` is a flags field which describes things like whether the section contains executable code, initialised/uninitialised data, etc.

The section headers can be inspected with PE-Bear:

Here, `Raw Addr` and `Virtual Addr` correspond to the `IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER.PointerToRawData` and `IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER.VirtualAddress` fields, respectively. `Raw Size` and `Virtual Size` correspond to `IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER.SizeOfRawData` and `IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER.VirtualSize`. The `Characteristics` fields gives us information about whether the section is read-only, writable, executable, etc.

# Data Directories

Data Directories represent pieces of data located within the sections of the PE file and contain information useful to the programme loader. They are simples structs defined in `<winnt.h>`:

```cpp
typedef struct _IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY {
    DWORD   VirtualAddress;
    DWORD   Size;
} IMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY, *PIMAGE_DATA_DIRECTORY;
```

The first member, `VirtualAddress` is an RVA pointing to the beginning of the Data Directory, while `Size` holds the number of bytes that the Data Directory occupies. While this is true of all Data Directories, each Data Directory is handled differently based on its type:

```cpp
// Directory Entries

#define IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_EXPORT          0   // Export Directory
#define IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IMPORT          1   // Import Directory
#define IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_RESOURCE        2   // Resource Directory
#define IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_EXCEPTION       3   // Exception Directory
#define IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_SECURITY        4   // Security Directory
#define IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_BASERELOC       5   // Base Relocation Table
#define IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_DEBUG           6   // Debug Directory
//      IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_COPYRIGHT       7   // (X86 usage)
#define IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_ARCHITECTURE    7   // Architecture Specific Data
#define IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_GLOBALPTR       8   // RVA of GP
#define IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_TLS             9   // TLS Directory
#define IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_LOAD_CONFIG    10   // Load Configuration Directory
#define IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_BOUND_IMPORT   11   // Bound Import Directory in headers
#define IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_IAT            12   // Import Address Table
#define IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_DELAY_IMPORT   13   // Delay Load Import Descriptors
#define IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_COM_DESCRIPTOR 14   // COM Runtime descriptor
```

The above are values represent the indices for the Optional Header's `DataDirectory` array at which each type of Data Directory is located.

If both the `VirtualAddress` and `Size` fields are set to 0, then this particular Data Directory is unused. 

Data Directories can be inspected under the Optional Header with PE-Bear:
