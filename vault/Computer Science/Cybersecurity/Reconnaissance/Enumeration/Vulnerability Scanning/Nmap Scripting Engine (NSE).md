# Introduction

Apart from being the most powerful port scanner, [[index|nmap]] also has its own *Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)* which greatly extends its functionality and can turn `nmap` into a lightweight vulnerability scanner. Invoking scripts is really easy to do and is done with the `--script` option:

```bash
nmap --script <script name> <target>
```

# Nmap Scripts

Nmap comes with a bunch of scripts by default, all of which are stored under `/usr/share/nmap/scripts` in Kali Linux and are index in a database file called `scripts.db`. These scripts are divided into several categories, but the ones which matter for vulnerability scanning are under the `vuln` category. 

To view the categories of a specific script, one can use the following command:

```bash
cat /usr/share/nmap/scripts/script.db | grep <script>
```

You might have noticed that the same script can belong to multiple categories. The `safe` category contains scripts which are safe to run and will not damage the target system, while scripts in the `intrusive` category may crash the target.

One can also install custom scripts from the Internet, usually found on GitHub. Once you have downloaded the `.nse` file, you need to place it in `/usr/share/nmap/scripts/` and run the following command to update Nmap's script database:

```bash
sudo nmap --script-updatedb
```

>[!WARNING] Warning: Malicious NSE Scripts
>
>Blindly executing unknown NSE scripts may compromise your system. You should always inspect the script's code and verify that it is not doing anything malicious on your host.
