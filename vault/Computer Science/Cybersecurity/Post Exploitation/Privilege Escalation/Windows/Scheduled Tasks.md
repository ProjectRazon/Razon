# Introduction

Windows Scheduled Tasks allow for the periodic execution of scripts. These can be manually enumerated via the following command:

```powershell
schtasks /query /fo LIST /v 
```

A scheduled task is of interest when it is executed with elevated privileges but we have write access to the script it executes.

This script is fairly simple, so we can just append a line to it which executes a malicious executable.

When the time for the scheduled task comes, we will catch an elevated shell.
