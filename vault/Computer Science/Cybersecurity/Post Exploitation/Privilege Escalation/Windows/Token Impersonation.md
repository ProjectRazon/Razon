# Introduction

Windows Access Tokens are objects which describe the security context in which a thread or process is run. The information within an access token identifies the user and their privileges of said process or thread. Upon each successful user log-on, an access token for the user is generated and every process executed by this user will contain a copy of this token called the *primary token*.

This token is used by the system to inspect the privileges of the process when the process tries to interact with something which may require certain privileges. However, threads of the process are allowed to use a second token, called an *impersonation token*, to interact with objects as if they had a different security context and different privileges. This is only allowed when the process has the `SeImpersonatePrivilege`.

As with [[Bypassing UAC|UAC bypassing]], exploiting token impersonation is highly dependent on the Windows build and version. However, the most infamous exploits are the [[https://jlajara.gitlab.io/Potatoes_Windows_Privesc|Potato exploits]].
