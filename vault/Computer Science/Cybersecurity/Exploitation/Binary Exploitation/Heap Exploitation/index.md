# Heap Exploitation

Exploitation techniques for the heap are different from those which work on the stack. In general, heap exploitation is more difficult and warrants creativity in order for an attack to be successful.

Heap exploitation usually relies on the already implemented logic of a binary and abuses it by providing the program with malicious data. A very common attack goal is to force the program to allocate two structs at the same memory, thereby corrupting them and possibly overwriting any function pointers or causing further overflows on the stack.

Another common technique is to force the heap manager to allocate and write to memory that is actually outside the heap, possibly overwriting the GOT or even just replacing blank return addresses.
