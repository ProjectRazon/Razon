# Overview

Open redirect vulnerabilities occur when a target visits a website which sends their browser to another URL. These attacks only redirect users and as such are often considered to be of low severity. 

# How Do They Work

Open redirects occur when a developer mistrusts user input, which redirects to another site, usually via a URL parameter, HTML `<meta>` tags, or the DOM window location property.

## URL Parameter Redirect

Suppose that Google could redirect users to their Gmail service via the following URL:
```
https://www.google.com/?redirect_to=https://www.gmail.com
```

In this case, visiting `www.google.com` would result in your browser sending an HTTP request to the Google web server. The server would process this request and return a status code - typically 302, although it may sometimes be 301, 303, 307, or 308. This code would inform the browser that the page has been found, however, it would also tell it to make an additional HTTP request to `www.gmail.com`. This will be noted in the `Location:` header of the HTTP response. This header specifies where to redirect `GET` requests. An attacker could change the value of the `redirect_to` parameter and forward you to their malicious server.

Common redirection parameter names include `url=`, `redirect=`, `next=`, however, they may also be denoted by a single letter at times.

## Meta Refresh Tag Redirect

HTML `<meta>` tags can tell a browser to reload a page and make a `GET` request to a specified URL. This URL is defined in the tag's `content` attribute.

This is an example of such a tag:
`<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=https://www.google.com/">`

First, the `content` attribute defines the number of seconds the browser should wait before making the request to the URL. Secondly, it specifies the URL to make the request to.

## Javascript Redirect
Open redirects can be exploited by modifying the window's `location` property through the Document Object Model. This property denotes where a request should be redirected to.

An attacker may change the `location` property through any of the following ways:

```javascript
window.location = https://www.google.com/  
window.location.href = https://www.google.com  
window.location.replace(https://www.google.com)
```

This type of open redirect is usually chained with some sort of XSS.
