The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol allows for the sharing of resources such as files or printers between machines on a LAN. It is a request-response protocol and the resource sharing occurs by dint of the so-called "shares". A *share* is what facilitates remote access to a directory. Shares may provide read-only or read-write access to the underlying directory depending on the configuration set.
