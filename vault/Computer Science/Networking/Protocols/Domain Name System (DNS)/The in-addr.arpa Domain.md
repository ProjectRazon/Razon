This is a special domain used for reverse DNS lookups. In the `in-addr.arpa` domain, IP addresses are represented as a sequence of four decimal numbers separated by dots. The suffix of `in-addr.arpa` is appended to the IP address. In this domain, however, IP address octets are read from right to left, but the contents of the octets are not. For example, in order to do a reverse lookup on `172.217.169.174`, you would use `174.169.217.172.in-addr.arpa`. This domain is used for reverse lookups on IPv4 addresses. 

For IPv6 addresses, the `ip6.arpa` domain is used. The address is represented by hex digits in reverse order - each digit looking like a domain name. For example, to do a reverse look up on `2001:db8::567:89ab`, you would use `b.a.9.8.7.6.5.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.8.b.d.0.1.0.0.2.ip6.arpa`.
