# How to Use Razon?

At first glance, Razon's size and organisation may seem daunting. This is because you are probably used to studying from textbooks or looking up things on Wikipedia, but Razon is neither. Hence using the project might be challenging at first, but you will quickly get accustomed and soon enough you will realise that Razon's implementation is superior to any textbook or encyclopedia.

The project can be used in two main ways:
- **Reference database** - the website's extensive search capability allows users to conduct detailed searches of its content which means that Razon can be used as a reference book for looking-up various pieces of knowledge. This is especially useful when you have a specific topic in mind which you want to learn about and can be a great way to supplement your courses by looking up definitions, theorems and examples.
- **Self-study** - thanks to [[index|Eisodos]], Razon can be used to self-study entire subjects. All you need to do is find the appropriate *diadromi* under Eisodos and then follow it through the content of the website, studying the material in each page. Ideally, each diadromi should be able to take you from zero-to-hero in the field it pertains to by using only Razon's content.

## Razon's Structure

There are two fundamental principles which underpin the structure of Razon's content:
- Non-linearity - the content in Razon follows no particular order. There is no beginning and no end. This is due to the fact that knowledge exists independently of the way and order in which it is acquired. In particular, a single concept may be related to several different concepts. These ideas can in turn be related to other concepts, some of which are also related to the first idea, whilst the rest are completely independent of it. Such complexity does not admit a correct order in which topics should be studied, hence all attempts to attribute a sequential structure to them will be fruitless.
- Hyperconnectivity - all pages in Razon are interconnected via links which makes hopping from one page to another a breeze. This is especially useful when you are reading a page and an unknown concept appears - simply click on it and you will be redirected to the concept's explanation.
